# Analytics Dashboard Studio — STATUS (hourly-loop resume anchor)

> **RESUME PROTOCOL:** An hourly cron (`17 * * * *`, fresh-session job) runs the improvement loop.
> **FILL THE RUN — this is the point:** you have the better part of an hour, so **keep working until your
> time/context budget is nearly spent, NOT until you've done "a task."** One or two slices and stopping is
> the failure mode to avoid — a normal fire should ship **many** improvements (aim for **~5–8+ slices**,
> more when they're small).
> On each fire: read THIS file first, then work in a tight inner loop —
> 1. Pick the top **NEXT** item that isn't already done.
> 2. Implement the smallest coherent, valuable slice of it.
> 3. Keep the Playwright suite **green**, update DONE/NEXT here, then **commit + push** that ONE slice.
> 4. **Immediately go back to step 1** and continue. Only stop when time/context is genuinely running out
>    (or at a clean checkpoint) — never because "one thing is done." Do a sweep instead of a feature only
>    when the SWEEP CADENCE calls for it.
> One commit per slice so progress always survives a mid-run stop. Push to `main` of
> `kevinrhaas/analytics.polecat.live` — main is the GitHub Pages deploy branch, so pushing publishes the
> live site at https://analytics.polecat.live. **Before each push `git pull --rebase origin main`** (a
> concurrent run may have pushed) so parallel/back-to-back runs coordinate and don't collide.
>
> **SWEEP CADENCE:** roughly every ~5th run (or whenever the feature backlog is thin), spend the run on a
> **sweep** instead of a new feature. **Rotate through three sweep types** (track which you did last in the
> DONE log so they cycle):
> 1. **UX / delight sweep (track H):** step back and make the app cleaner, more logical, more elegant, and
>    more **fun, interactive, engaging, and sexy** — IA/menus, onboarding, motion/micro-delight, visual
>    polish. Small, safe, well-tested slices; never a wild rewrite.
> 2. **Architecture & code-review sweep (track L):** review the codebase like a senior engineer — module
>    boundaries, dead code, duplication, global-state creep, perf (bundle size / render cost), a11y,
>    error handling, test coverage per feature, and the chart-extension API surface. Fix ONE concrete
>    health issue per sweep (refactor behind green tests, no behavior change) and log findings.
> 3. **Innovation / roadmap sweep (track N):** look **back** at everything shipped and **forward** at
>    what's now possible, and be **exceptionally innovative** — add 2–4 genuinely leading ideas to the
>    Track N innovation backlog (below), then optionally build the smallest delightful slice of one.
>    The north star is meant to keep expanding; this sweep is how it grows.
> This is ongoing, not one-and-done. Keep every sweep shippable and tested.

> **GOAL / NORTH STAR:** build **Analytics Dashboard Studio** into a best-in-class, gorgeous, fun,
> industry-leading **analytics application** (analytics.polecat.live) — not just a dashboard builder.
> The direction: a multi-section app (Home · Repository · Studio · Settings) where you connect to
> **many data providers directly** (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, generic SQL — plus Pentaho CDA),
> author stunning interactive dashboards, and manage data sources + workbooks — heading toward
> standalone analytic apps with forecasting/statistics. Everything stays **pure HTML/JS, config saved
> locally, no backend** (for now). Aesthetic: fun, clean, elegant, a little **game-like**, on the
> Polecat warm-dark design language. The visual **dashboard builder** (the "Studio" section, exporting
> byte-faithful self-contained HTML) is the mature core; the ★ Z backlog below drives the platform
> expansion. Terminology is generic (Data Access, Dashboard Framework); Pentaho remains one supported
> backend, not the framing.

## Environment / how to work
- Project root: the **repository root** of `kevinrhaas/analytics.polecat.live` (the app is the repo —
  no `dashboard-studio/` subfolder). Plain HTML/JS, no framework, no build step.
- Serve: `./serve.sh` (→ http://localhost:8000). Must be served (fetch); `file://` won't work.
- **Test:** from the repo root: `NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g) node tests/run.js` (Playwright, global at
  `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules`, Chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`).
  Keep it **green**; add a check for each new feature.
- Regenerate catalog/examples from the reference suite: `python3 tools/import-v2.py` (reads
  `reference/dashboards/`).
- One spec drives all: `app/model.js` (registry+helpers) → `app/studio-render.js` (in-iframe render +
  in-canvas editing) ↔ `app/studio.js` (builder) → `app/exporters.js` (CDA/CDE/CDF). `SPEC.md` = schema.
- Preview iframe == exported CDF html (same toolkit inlined). Builder ↔ iframe talk via postMessage
  (`{studio:1,type:select|reorder|resize|...}`).

## Conventions (apply to ALL output, every run)
- **HTML + JS only, light dependencies.** No Java, no Python, no build step, no heavy frameworks, no
  package installs baked into exported artifacts. The vendored toolkit stays self-contained; new chart
  types/features go in `app/studio-charts.js`. Exported files (CDF .html / CDE / .cda / bundle) must
  stay small and dependency-light so the Pentaho team can drop them in anywhere.
- **Clean code.** Cohesive modules (model/render/studio/exporters boundaries), consistent style, no dead
  code, no mess.
- **Documented for the humans.** Add helpful, friendly, supportive comments where a
  human needs orientation — explain the *why* and any non-obvious technique. Concise, not verbose. If
  existing code is thin on comments and a reader would struggle, add brief contextual notes.
- **Keep the in-app docs current.** `docs/index.html` is the user-facing Help reference (linked from the
  app). Whenever you add or change a user-facing feature, **update the docs in the SAME slice** so they
  never drift, and make sure the app links to them discoverably (see Z11).
- **License.** The Studio is proprietary — see `LICENSE` (© 2026 Polecat.live; all rights reserved).
  Keep the notice intact; don't add OSS license headers that contradict it. New first-party source
  files may carry a one-line header (`/* Analytics Dashboard Studio — © 2026 Polecat.live. See LICENSE. */`).
  Do NOT relicense or add notices to vendored third-party toolkit files.

## DONE
- v1: 3-pane builder (library · live-preview iframe · inspector); 67-CDA library; chart registry
  (bars/donut/line/stacked/treemap/scatter/gauge/heatmap/table/kpi); offline sample-data generator;
  exporters CDF .html / CDE .cdfde+.wcdf / .cda / bundle; 16 v2 CDE boards + flagship as examples;
  Playwright suite. CDE export matches v2 cde-*.cdfde 1:1.
- v2: drag-to-reorder (header grip) + drag-to-resize (right edge → span), live, postMessage-driven.
- v3: **cross-row drag** (insertion caret + cursor ghost + end-of-grid drop zone) and **inline
  rename** (double-click a panel title on the canvas).
- v4: **Undo/Redo** — snapshot history of settled spec states; ↶/↷ topbar buttons + Ctrl/Cmd-Z /
  Shift-Z (Y); ignores text-field edits.
- v5: **inline validation panel** (live Checks in the dashboard inspector — errors/warnings/info +
  "ready to export"), **KPI reorder** (↑/↓ parity with panels), **onboarding empty-state** (styled
  CTA on a blank/New dashboard).
- v6: **keyboard reorder/resize** — with a panel selected (builder focused): ↑/↓ reorder, Shift+←/→
  resize span; inspector hint added.
- v7: **builder dark mode** (theme toggle now themes the whole app + preview together, persisted) and
  **first-class export modal** (every export → modal with per-file size + copy-to-clipboard + download;
  bundle keeps Download-all).
- v8: **CLI exporter** `tools/export.js` + **`deploy.sh`** (generate .cda/.html/.cdfde/.wcdf from a
  .studio.json outside the browser, reusing app/exporters.js; `--all` exports every example) and
  **per-series color pickers** for line/stacked charts. Test suite now 36/36.

> **LOOP NOTE (env):** session-only cron does NOT survive container reclamation; a re-arm was needed
> after the gap. Crons only fire while a session is warm. Treat autonomous runs as best-effort; the
> STATUS backlog is the source of truth so any warm session can resume.

- v9: **visual chart gallery** — chart-type picker shows mini SVG thumbnails per type.
- v10: **deeper CDE round-trip** — treemap→cccTreemapChart, scatter→cccMetricDotChart,
  heatmap→cccHeatGridChart (real editable CCC components, no more bar-fallback/omit). Only gauge +
  table remain CDF-only. Test suite now 41/41.

- v11: **first-class filter builder** — filters now edit inline in the inspector (own selection kind,
  like panels/KPIs) with a **live options preview** (chips); helper-queries with no parsed alias fall
  back to the sample column so the value picker + preview always work. Test suite now 44/44.

- v12: **KPI extras** (delta indicator + sparkline column/color in the inspector; ✕ delete a KPI from
  the canvas) and **New ▾ → auto-build** a starter dashboard from any catalog query set (instant,
  editable: KPIs from a `kpi` da + a chart per chartable da, chart type inferred). Test suite now 51/51.

- v12: **KPI extras** (delta + sparkline; ✕ delete a KPI from the canvas) and **New ▾ → auto-build**
  a starter dashboard from any catalog query set.
- v13: **panel duplicate/delete** — hover ⧉/× actions on every canvas card + Duplicate/Delete buttons
  in the panel inspector.
- v14: **stacked-area chart** — new `areaStacked` type via a toolkit EXTENSION (`app/studio-charts.js`,
  keeps vendored pdc-ui.js a pristine v2 mirror); renders cumulative bands + hover tooltip in CDF and
  round-trips to CDE as `cccStackedAreaChart`. Exporters/CLI inline the extension. Test suite now 56/56.
  → 11 chart types; CDE covers 8 (bars/donut/line/stacked/areaStacked/treemap/scatter/heatmap).

- v15: **Pentaho server connections** — `app/pentaho.js`: Kettle `<slaveserver>` XML parse/serialize,
  `Studio.parseCDA` (CDA XML → catalog), `Studio.PentahoClient` (repo browse / getFile / doQuery /
  publishFile via standard Pentaho REST). Connections manager UI (⚙ Servers): CRUD, import/export
  Kettle XML, set active (persisted in localStorage). Active connection drives live preview;
  "Import sources…" pulls CDAs from the repo into the library; Export ▸ Push publishes all artifacts
  to the server. Offline-verifiable parts tested (62/62); **live network paths built but unverified
  here (no server)** — need reachable server + cookie/CORS auth.

- v16: **CDE import (round-trip edit)** — `Studio.parseCDE(.cdfde,.wcdf,cda)` rebuilds an editable
  studio spec (title/desc from wcdf, chart types reversed from CCC components, columns re-bound from
  the CDA, spans from the layout). Import modal now has Queries→library AND Dashboards→open&edit;
  "Open" pulls .cdfde+.cda+.wcdf and loads it. Verified by export→import round-trip. 65/65.

- v17: **combo (bar+line dual-axis)** chart [CDF-only] + **cascading filters** (parameterized filter
  options reload from upstream filter state, selection preserved) + **`tools/proxy.js`** dev proxy
  (serves Studio + forwards /pentaho/* → one origin, no CORS, cookie auth; preview iframe inherits it)
  so the user can test live against a local Pentaho. 13 chart types. Test suite 67/67.

- v18: **scheduling toolchain** — `tools/lib.js` (shared Node build, Node-safe Kettle parser),
  `tools/push.js` (build+publish via the publish API: --spec/--all/--dir, --server/--kettle/env auth,
  --deploy, **--interval** for scheduled deploy, **--dry-run**), `tools/schedule-job.js` (register a
  Pentaho /api/scheduler/job for run/email). export.js refactored onto lib.js. 70/70.

- v19: **CDF (.html) import** — `Studio.parseCDFHtml` recovers the full editable spec from any
  Studio-exported CDF (reads the embedded `window.STUDIO_SPEC` via brace-balanced scan). Open dialog
  now accepts `.html` as well as `.studio.json`. 71/71.

- v20: **polish** — duplicate/delete KPI from the inspector, **Ctrl/Cmd+D** duplicates the selected
  panel or KPI, combo gets a separate **line (right-axis) format**, and the filter inspector shows a
  **cascading hint** when its options query is parameterized. 75/75.

- v21: **publish + gate + welcome** — passcode gate (`app/gate.js`+`gate-config.js`, default code
  `pentaho-studio`, SHA-256 in config), first-run **welcome tour** (`app/welcome.js`, 5 steps, reopen
  via ⓘ Tour), `CNAME`, and the `PUBLISH.md` runbook (Pages + DNS + Cloudflare Access). 82/82.

- v22: **hosting model** (historical; superseded by the v60 standalone migration). The site originally
  published from a separate Pages repo via a mirror script; that indirection is gone now that this repo
  *is* the published site (GitHub Pages serves the repo root).

- v23: branding + access pass (gate, welcome, topbar, title, export footer). Gate now accepts a
  **list of access codes** (issue/revoke several); `tools/gen-code.js` hashes a code for
  `app/gate-config.js`. 84/84.

- v24: **resizable + collapsible side panels** (drag the handles; collapse to a labeled rail; widths/state persisted), **dark-mode fixes** (library cards & inputs no longer white; brighter accents), and the inspector list-row overlap fix.

- v25: **published live** (historical) with the v23–v24 changes via the old mirror-to-Pages-repo
  script. Superseded by the v60 migration — this repo now deploys directly through GitHub Pages with
  no mirror step.

- v26: **auto-publish CI** (historical — a separate-repo mirror workflow, superseded by the v60
  migration; this repo now auto-deploys from `main` via GitHub Pages).
  Plus **a11y keyboard focus rings** (`:focus-visible` outline themed via --pentaho; covered by a Tab
  test). 88/88.

- v27: **status-bar footer** pinned to the bottom with a “Last updated” build stamp + version, and a
  **collapsible Changelog** (newest revision first) opened from the footer. History lives in
  `app/changelog.js` (add new entries at the TOP); the publish CI stamps the real UTC deploy time into
  the footer via the `__BUILD_TS__` token (falls back to the latest entry's date locally). 91/91.
  NOTE: Playwright isn't installable on the author's Mac — the suite runs in the loop/CI, not locally;
  local validation here was node --check + a data/stamp sanity run.

- v28: **per-panel query peek** — “Query preview” section in the panel inspector shows the bound
  query's SQL snippet (truncated at 140 chars with Show/Collapse toggle), column headers, and 3
  offline sample rows in a compact scrollable table. Test suite now 95/95.

- v29: **lone `.cdfde` import** — `Studio.cdaFromCdfde` reconstructs an editable CDA (id, kind
  sql/mdx/mql/kettle/scripting/olap4j/xpath/compound, jndi/catalog, query, parameters, columns —
  declared `cdacolumns` or inferred from SQL `AS` aliases, calculated columns, cache) purely from a
  `.cdfde`'s embedded `datasources` section. `parseCDE(cdfde)` now works with NO `.wcdf`/`.cda`; the
  Open dialog accepts a bare `.cdfde` and renders it. (First step of the CDA-authoring track.)

- v30: **CI test gate** — the publish workflow now runs the Playwright suite in a `test` job that
  `publish` depends on, so a failing build (even an autonomous-loop commit) can never deploy to the
  live site. `tests/run.js` falls back to Playwright's own Chromium when the sandbox path is absent
  (CI install). Plus a standing **master access code** added to `app/gate-config.js` (hash only).

- v31: **data-source builder (CDA authoring — slice 1/8)** — “＋ New source” in the library opens a
  guided builder: visual **source-type cards** (SQL / MDX / Kettle / Metadata / Scripting), id + group +
  JNDI, a monospace query editor, **”Detect from query”** that reads `… AS alias` columns into editable
  chips (plus manual add), a parameters mini-editor, and a **live offline preview table** that updates
  as you type. Save writes the data source into the library (grouped); every card now has inline
  **✎ edit / 🗑 delete**. Authored sources are immediately usable by panels/KPIs and flow through the
  existing `.cda`/`.cdfde`/`.cdf` exporters. 100/100.

- v32: **CDA connections manager (slice 2/8)** — 7 named connection types (`sql.jndi`, `sql.jdbc`,
  `mondrian.jndi`, `olap4j`, `metadata`, `kettle.TransFromFile`, `scripting`) with type-specific fields
  in an editor modal. Dashboard inspector: “CDA Connections” section (＋/edit/delete); DA inspector:
  connection picker (shown when connections are defined). `exportCDA` now emits correct
  `<Connection type=…>` XML for all types + the right DA `type` attribute (sql/mdx/mql/kettle/scripting).
  `Studio.daAccessType`, `Studio.cdaConnectionXml` exposed for tooling. Test suite 119/119.

- v33: **per-kind query editors (slice 3/8)** — the data source builder and DA inspector now show
  type-aware query controls: SQL keeps textarea + detect; MDX adds catalog path; Kettle shows .ktr path
  + step name (no textarea); Metadata adds Domain ID; Scripting adds language selector. `exportCDA` emits
  `<KtrFile>/<Step>` for kettle DAs and `<Language>/<InitScript/>/<QueryScript>` for scripting DAs
  (previously all kinds emitted `<Query>`). Test suite 127/127.

- v34: **assisted column + parameter tooling (slice 4/8)** — calculated columns UI in both builder
  modal and DA inspector (name + formula `=[col1]+[col2]` + type picker); `exportCDA` now emits a proper
  `<CalculatedColumns>` block (or `<CalculatedColumns/>` when empty). Parameter type dropdown added to
  the DA inspector (was missing — builder already had it). `Studio.COLUMN_TYPES` constant (String /
  Integer / Numeric / Date / Boolean) shared across builder, inspector, and model. Test suite 134/134.

- v35: **joins / compound data access (slice 5/8)** — `⧈ Join` button in the library opens a guided
  builder for Pentaho CDA `<CompoundDataAccess>`: join (pick left/right DA + key columns) or union
  (stack rows from N DAs). `exportCDA` emits correct `<CompoundDataAccess type=”join|union”>` XML;
  `parseCDA` round-trips both kinds. Compound DA inspector shows join keys / union members inline.
  Test suite 146/146.

- v36: **output options (slice 6/8)** — “Output options” section in the DA inspector: filter rules
  (column + operator + value; 8 operators including text `contains`/`startsWith`), sort rules (column +
  direction), and a row limit. All rules applied client-side to offline sample data in preview and
  live-preview iframe; `exportCDA` emits an `<OutputOptions>` block (Filter/SortBy/RowLimit) for
  server-side post-processing where CDA supports it. `Studio.applyOutputOptions`, `Studio.DA_OPS`,
  `Studio.newOutputFilter`, `Studio.newOutputSort` exposed. Test suite 163/163.

- v37: **sophisticated DA preview (slice 7/8)** + **icon registry (I1)** —
  DA inspector: “Data preview” section auto-runs sample on open; parameter inputs (pre-filled from defaults); paginated table (10 rows/page, ‹/› nav); column type badges (String/Numeric/Date inferred from name + sample values); row+col status line; Copy-as-TSV button (whole result); optional “▶ Run live” button (doQuery via active server, graceful fallback).
  New `app/icons.js`: `Studio.icon(name[,size])` helper returns inline `<svg>` with `stroke:currentColor`, `fill:none`, 1.5px stroke, 24-box viewBox — 26 icons covering the full app vocabulary. Groundwork for I2+ adoption. Test suite 188/188.

- v38: **`.cda` round-trip parity (slice 8/8, CDA track complete)** — `parseCDA` now handles all 7 connection types (sql.jndi, sql.jdbc, mondrian.jndi, olap4j, metadata, kettle.TransFromFile, scripting) with type-specific fields; maps DA `type` attribute → `DA_KINDS` id (sql→sql.jndi, mdx→mondrian.jndi, mql→metadata, etc.); parses Kettle ktrPath/ktrStep, Scripting scriptLang/script body, CalculatedColumns, and OutputOptions (filter/sort/limit with operator reversal). Returns `connections[]` (full typed array); `parseCDE` propagates it into the spec for multi-connection imports. Each DA carries `connectionId`. Test suite 203/203 (15 new checks).

- v39: **responsive shell (M1)** — real breakpoints (≤900px tablet, ≤640px phone) replacing the stale 1100px @media rule. At ≤900px the topbar collapses secondary actions (Tour / Servers / Live / Theme) into a ⋯ More dropdown menu; brand + primary actions always visible. At ≤640px dash-id is hidden, brand tightened. The 3-pane workspace scrolls horizontally at tablet width. Test suite 208/208 (5 new phone-viewport checks).
- v40: **mobile drawers (M2)** — at ≤640px, Query Library and Inspector become slide-in off-canvas drawers; a bottom tab bar (Library · Canvas · Inspector) drives navigation; translucent scrim appears/closes on tap; viewport resize from phone→desktop auto-resets state. Test suite 220/220 (12 new checks).
- v41: **icon adoption across chrome (I2)** — all builder chrome now uses `Studio.icon()` SVG: delBtn, moveBtn (chevrons), section add (+), myDACard dup/del, daCard edit/del, DS_TYPES source-type cards (sql→db, mdx→cube, kettle→gear, mql→metadata, scripting→code), topbar undo/redo. Two new icons added (code, metadata). CSS flex-centering for .icobtn/.add/.da-act/.dsb-type .ic. Dark mode works for free. Test suite 231/231 (11 new I2 checks).
- v42: **icon adoption in canvas + modals (I3)** — completes the SVG icon sweep. Canvas sr-act panel buttons (⧉/×) replaced via `iSvg()` local helper in the iframe scope. KPI tile delete → SVG. Modal close → SVG (CSS updated to inline-flex). Toast → SVG check/warn + flex alignment. All secondary topbar buttons (Theme/Servers/Live/Tour) → setIconBtn() SVG. Inspector dup/del btn-wide → SVG duplicate/trash. DA preview buttons, pagination, chip/param/calc-col remove, addP/addCC/New/Join all → SVG. flashBtn() saves innerHTML (not textContent). `window.__fireToast` test hook added. Test suite 243/243 (12 new I3 checks).

- v43: **touch interactions + mobile modals (M3/M4)** — `setPointerCapture` + `pointercancel` on reorder/resize drag handlers for reliable touch tracking; `touch-action:none` on panel h3 + `.sr-resize` + `.resizer` to prevent scroll hijacking; ≥36/40px tap targets for `.da-act`/`.chip` at ≤640px; `.da-acts` always visible on mobile. Modals become bottom-sheet style on phone (full-width, anchored bottom, round top corners); `.modal-h` is `sticky`; `.dsb-foot` sticky at scroll-bottom; all modal inputs force `font-size:16px` (no iOS zoom); DS type cards stack 1-col. Test suite 252/252 (9 new M3/M4 checks).
- v44: **responsive exported dashboards (M5)** — `buildHtml` injects a `@media(max-width:640px)` block into every CDF export and preview iframe: header `flex-wrap:wrap`, subtitle hidden, `pdc-wrap` padding reduced, KPI gap reduced, brand font/logo scaled down. Chart grid was already 1-col at ≤720px via pdc-ui.css. SVGs use `width:100%` + `PDC.redrawAll` on window resize. Test suite 258/258 (6 new M5 checks).
- v45: **touch polish (M6)** — momentum scroll (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch` + `overscroll-behavior:contain`) on all scrollable regions; `:active` states for touch devices mirror hover; inspector fonts bumped at ≤640px (heading 12.5px, labels 12px, row titles 13.5px); `overflow-x:hidden` on topbar/panes at phone width. Test suite 263/263 (5 new M6 checks).
- v46: **icon polish + a11y (I4)** — exported CDF HTML: `aria-label` added to `#qInfoBtn` and `#themeBtn`; `studio-render.js` boot now sets theme button to SVG moon/sun + dynamic `aria-label` instead of `☾`/`☀` unicode. Test suite 266/266 (3 new I4 checks).
- v47: **search highlighting + keyboard shortcuts modal** — library search wraps matches in `<mark class="hl">` (gold/amber per theme); `?` key + More ▸ "Keyboard shortcuts" opens a modal listing all shortcuts with `<kbd>` chips; `Escape` now closes any modal globally. Test suite 274/274 (8 new checks).

- v48: **focus trap + auto-save + Ctrl+S** — modals now trap Tab focus (first element auto-focused on open; Tab/Shift+Tab cycles within modal, WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.2); auto-save writes spec to `localStorage` after each user edit (1.5 s debounce), shows a "Restore unsaved work?" banner on next session; Ctrl/Cmd+S downloads the spec (listed in shortcuts modal). Test suite 278/278 (4 new checks).

- v49: **restore-banner detail + export history (E1/E2)** — restore banner now shows panel/KPI/filter counts so user can decide without restoring; boot-time example load no longer clears autosave; Export menu shows last-5 "Recent exports" (format · name · time-ago, persisted in localStorage). 287/287.
- v50: **deep-link filter parameters (E4)** — URL hash `#filterId=value` pairs pre-select filters in exported CDF dashboards; `studio-render.js` patches `PDC.urlParams` to include hash params (lower priority than query string); dashboard inspector shows a "Shareable link" section with current filter defaults as a hash string + "Copy filter hash" button. **Changelog search (E6)** — live search input in the changelog popup filters entries dynamically with `<mark>` highlighting; `.cl-empty` no-match state. Test suite 296/296.

- v52: **radar / spider chart (F3, track F kickoff)** — new CDF-only chart type selectable in the gallery; concentric rings + labelled spokes + per-series polygons + vertex hover tooltips + legend + optional fill; theme-aware and animated (respects reduced-motion). model.js registry + studio-render dispatch + studio-charts.js renderer + gallery thumbnail + 2 Playwright checks. Test suite 309/309.
- v53: **sign out + clear local data (E8)** — "Sign out" and "Clear local data…" in ⋯ More menu; Sign out clears gate session flag + reloads; Clear local data confirms + wipes all Studio localStorage keys (autosave, export-history, theme, pane widths, connections, layout) + reloads. 5 new E8 tests. Test suite 314/314.
- v54: **waterfall chart (F4)** — CDF-only floating-bar chart: positive deltas green, negative red, optional Total bar in brand blue; dashed connectors; zero baseline when values straddle zero; hover tooltips (delta + running total); animation. Gallery thumbnail + 2 new F4 tests. Test suite 316/316.
- v55: **Sankey (F1) + Chord (F2)** — promotes existing PDC toolkit primitives to first-class chart types. Sankey: source→target ribbons scaled by value, hover shows value+%, Inspector options (srcCap/dstCap/fmt/height). Chord: circular arc diagram, hover highlights connections. Both CDF-only, same sourceCol/targetCol/valueCol binding, gallery SVG thumbnails, inspector labels, newPanel auto-mapping. Test suite 320/320 (4 new checks).
- v56: **Funnel chart (F5)** — stage-to-stage conversion visualization. Centred bars shrink by value; hover tooltips show value + conversion %; optional "Show conversion %" inspector toggle adds dim % annotations. PDC.funnel extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine). Gallery thumbnail, registry, newPanel auto-map (labelCol/valueCol). Test suite 322/322 (2 new F5 checks).
- v57: **Sunburst chart (F6)** — hierarchical part-of-whole visualization (pairs with Treemap). Single-ring mode: arcs proportional to value + center total label. Two-ring mode: when a groupCol is bound, inner ring = groups (aggregate totals), outer ring = items within each group — hierarchy immediately visible.

- v122: **F31: Population pyramid chart (44th type)** — Comparison group, CDF-only; mirrored horizontal bars from a shared centre axis (labelCol = category, leftCol = left measure, rightCol = right measure); bars animate from centre outward (ease-out-quad, staggered 35 ms/row); value labels inside wide bars; hover tooltips per bar; inspector options: Left/Right side labels (text), Left/Right bar colors (color tokens), format, height; PDC.pyramidBar extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnails in CHART_SVG and model.js thumb; autoPickCols maps first string → labelCol, first/second numeric → leftCol/rightCol; docs updated to 44 types; fixed stale "All 20 chart types" → "All 44 chart types" in docs Simple vs Advanced section. 3 new F31 checks. Test suite 663/663. 44 chart types total.
- v125: **F34: Grouped bar chart (47th type) + H-track: Slideshow mode** — F34: side-by-side multi-series bar chart per category (Comparison group, CDF-only); bars auto-centered in each group; labelCol + multi-series binding; Rotate/Format/Height options; clickable legend (_toggleLegend); staggered animated entrance; PDC.groupedBars extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); 4 new F34 checks. Slideshow: full-screen panel-by-panel presentation mode; ◀/▶ buttons + arrow keys; Escape/× to exit; same buildHtml+iframe pipeline as Panel zoom; test hooks; CSS in studio.css; 4 new H-track checks. Test suite 683/683. 47 chart types total.
- v127: **F36: 100% Normalized Stacked Bar chart (49th type) + J-track: docs updated to 49 types** — barNorm (F36, Composition group, CDF-only): every bar scaled to 100% and divided into proportional colour-coded segments; labelCol + multi-series binding; fixed 0–100% y-axis; clickable legend; column-by-column staggered animated entrance; hover tooltips (category, series, raw value, %); PDC.barNorm extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnails in CHART_SVG and model.js thumb; autoPickCols; 5 new F36/J checks. J-track: docs/index.html updated to 49 chart types (added ct-barNorm + ct-ridgeline cards, updated type counts). Test suite 694/694. 49 chart types total.
- v128: **F37: Area range / confidence band chart (50th type)** — `areaRange` (Trend group, CDF-only): shaded semi-transparent band between upper (solid) and lower (dashed) bound lines with an optional bolder centre/actual/forecast line. Band opacity configurable (5–60%, default 22%); animation: band fades in first, boundary lines next, centre line last. autoPickCols prefers low/min/floor for lowerCol and high/max/ceil for upperCol. centerCol is optional. PDC.areaRange extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnails in CHART_SVG and model.js thumb; docs updated to 50 chart types (ct-areaRange in Trend group). 5 new F37 tests. Test suite 699/699. 50 chart types total.
- v129: **F38: Quadrant chart (51st type)** — `quadrant` (Comparison group, CDF-only): scatter-style x/y plane divided into four labelled zones by configurable X split % and Y split % threshold sliders. Dots colour-coded by quadrant (blue=top-right, purple=top-left, red=bottom-left, green=bottom-right); subtle zone tints; dashed divider lines; italic corner labels (default: High Value / Explore / Low Priority / Quick Wins, all editable); short point labels; hover tooltips (label + x + y). Perfect for BCG matrix, effort/impact prioritisation, performance/potential, risk/probability. PDC.quadrant extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnails; autoPickCols; docs updated to 51 types (ct-quadrant in Comparison group). 5 new F38 checks. Test suite 704/704. 51 chart types total.
- v132: **Z1: App shell — collapsible left rail (Home · Repository · Studio · Settings)** — kicks off the analytics-app north star. `app/shell.js` + rail markup in `index.html`: a warm-dark left rail with single-color icons per section (amber Home / teal Repository / blue Studio / violet Settings); collapses to icons-only or expands to icon+label; both collapse state and active section persist in localStorage; roving ↑/↓ keyboard nav + `aria-current`. The existing 3-pane builder moves under Studio with **zero feature loss** — just wrapped in a new `#appMain`, nothing inside it changed. Home/Repository/Settings show friendly "coming soon" placeholders for now (real content in later Z-track slices). Scoped to desktop: rail hidden ≤900px and Studio always wins on narrow viewports, so mobile/tablet behavior (drawers, tab bar, MNAV) is untouched. 3 new icons (home/layers/grid) in `app/icons.js`. 8 new Z1 checks. Test suite 713/713.
- v133: **Z2: Home — a real landing page (quick-create + recents)** — replaces the Z1 Home placeholder with a working landing page: 3 quick-create cards (Blank dashboard / Browse examples / Take the tour) + a "Recent dashboards" grid. Recents are captured on the same debounce path as auto-save (`scheduleNoteRecent()` in `doRefresh()`); each entry stores a full spec clone (capped at 8, newest-first, `localStorage["studio-recents"]`) so a recent card genuinely reopens that exact dashboard. Cards render a live SVG thumbnail via the existing `Studio.makeThumbnail()`, theme-aware at paint time. Also fixed a Z1 CSS specificity bug (`.app-sec.has-content` vs `.app-sec[hidden]`, equal specificity, source-order win) that could leave a populated Home section visible while `hidden` — scoped to `:not([hidden])`. 5 new Z2 checks. Test suite 718/718.
- v134: **Z12 (slices 1–3): favicon + de-duped app identity** — added a real favicon (`favicon.svg`, terracotta-gradient bar-chart mark) wired via `<link rel="icon">` + `apple-touch-icon` + `site.webmanifest` + `theme-color` (the tab was blank before this). Removed the redundant single-letter "P" square from the topbar next to the full wordmark; the styled "Analytics Dashboard Studio" wordmark is now the sole identity in the content header. Anchored the app's persistent identity at the TOP of the left rail instead — a compact brand mark + "Dashboard Studio" label (`#railBrand` in `index.html`, wired in `app/shell.js`) that collapses to just the mark and jumps to Home on click, cf. Linear/VS Code/Notion. Exported dashboards and the passcode gate screen (their own separate `.pdc-logo`/`.g-logo` "P" marks) are untouched — out of scope, addressed separately under Z6. 5 new Z12 checks. Test suite 723/723.
- v136: **Z11: discoverable Help entry + Z5 follow-up: Settings export/import as JSON** — added a persistent **Help** link (`#railHelp`) at the bottom of the left rail (below Settings, above the collapse toggle) that opens `docs/index.html` in a new tab — the docs were previously buried in the ⋯ More menu, per the Z11 user report. Settings gained a **Data** card: **Export settings** downloads a `dashboard-studio-settings.json` with theme/mode/connections/layout preferences (not dashboard content — that stays on Save/Open); **Import settings** restores it (validated + confirmed before applying, then reloads). `applySettingsData()` factored out for testability. `docs/index.html` updated. 4 new checks. Test suite 733/733.
- v137: **Z9: fix invisible topbar dropdowns at tablet width** — found the root cause of a user-reported mobile regression ("the top button-bar scrolls/slides but its dropdown menus don't open/work"): at tablet widths (641–900px), `#topbar`/`.top-actions` need `overflow:hidden` to stop the button row from forcing page-level horizontal scroll, but that same clip box was also hiding every dropdown (New ▾ / Examples ▾ / Export ▾ / ⋯ More) since `.menu` is `position:absolute` and extends below the topbar's own box — the menu still gained `.open` and reported normal computed styles, so both a DOM check and Playwright's default click/tap actionability check reported success while it was genuinely unrendered on screen (confirmed via screenshot). Extended the same `position:fixed` escape hatch already used at ≤640px (phone) to the tablet range, anchored under its button instead of stretched full-width. Added an `elementFromPoint`-based regression test (the only kind that catches ancestor-overflow clipping) for New ▾/Export ▾/⋯ More at a tablet viewport; verified it fails on the old CSS and passes on the fix. 4 new checks. Test suite 737/737.
- v135: **Z5 slice 1: Settings — first-class mode toggle switches** — the Settings section (left rail) is no longer a placeholder: Dark mode / Simple mode / Demo mode / Focus mode now show as clear, labelled on/off switches grouped into Appearance / Mode / Presentation cards, instead of being buried in the ⋯ More menu (a user-reported pain point). Each switch wraps the existing mode function directly (setTheme/toggleSimpleMode/toggleDemoMode/enter·exitFocusMode) so there's no parallel state to drift — the switch, the ⋯ More item, and any shortcut always agree; toggling Focus mode from Settings jumps into Studio to show the effect immediately, and exiting via Escape is reflected back in the switch next time Settings is shown. New `.set-sw` toggle-switch component matches the warm-dark Home aesthetic. `docs/index.html` updated. 6 new Z5 tests. Test suite 729/729.
- v126: **F35: Ridgeline / joy plot (48th type) + H-track: Inspector expand all / collapse all** — Ridgeline (F35, Distribution group, CDF-only): horizontally stacked KDE density curves per category with configurable overlap ratio (0–0.9); shared value x-axis; category labels colored to match their ridge; Gaussian KDE (Silverman bandwidth, same as violin); fill + outline per ridge; hover tooltips (category, count, median); staggered animated entrance bottom-to-top; labelCol + valueCol binding; PDC.ridgeline extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnail in CHART_SVG and model.js thumb; 3 new F35 checks. Inspector expand/collapse-all: two compact buttons ("Expand all" / "Collapse all") below the search bar instantly expand or collapse all inspector sections; state persisted via _collapsedSects + localStorage; 3 new H126 checks. Test suite 689/689. 48 chart types total.
- v124: **F33: Pareto chart (46th type) + H-track: '/' keyboard shortcut for gallery search** — Pareto: Comparison group, CDF-only; bars sorted descending (largest leftmost), secondary right y-axis 0–100% with orange cumulative % line + dot markers, optional dashed 80% reference line; labelCol+valueCol binding; animated 2-phase entrance (bars staggered, then line fades in); PDC.pareto extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnails in CHART_SVG and model.js thumb; dispatch in studio-render.js; 4 new F33 checks. H-track '/' shortcut: pressing '/' when a panel is selected focuses .cg-search (chart-type gallery search); guards against input/textarea/select targets + modifier keys; listed in shortcuts modal (?); 2 new H-track checks. Test suite 675/675. 46 chart types total.
- v123: **F32: Icicle/partition chart (45th type) + H-track: series color palette presets** — Icicle: Composition group, CDF-only; two-level rectangular partition where parent groups appear as proportional column-strips across the top 36% and children fill the bottom 64% within each parent column; encodes both the parent-to-whole ratio (column width) and within-parent composition (sub-column width); labelCol+valueCol+groupCol binding; single-level mode when groupCol omitted; hover tooltips; staggered animated entrance (L→R); PDC.icicle extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnails in both CHART_SVG (studio.js) and model.js thumb; autoPickCols; 3 new F32 checks. Palette presets (H-track): 5 built-in series palettes (default/ocean/forest/sunset/dusk), each with separate light-mode and dark-mode ramps; 'Series palette' swatch row in dashboard inspector; selected palette injects --c1…--c10 CSS variable overrides into preview and CDF export; spec.paletteKey; Studio.PALETTE_PRESETS in model.js; paletteCss in exporters.js; 3 new H-palette checks. Test suite 669/669. 45 chart types total.
- v138: **Z8 slice 1: context-aware inspector** — `Studio.ANNOT_CAPS` capability map + `Studio.chartSupports(kind, type)` in `app/model.js` records which chart types the renderer actually wires each interaction feature into (mirrors the real per-type dispatch in `studio-render.js`: drill only for bars/donut, detail drawer for bars/donut/treemap/table, cross-filter + conditional formatting + color scale for bars/donut/treemap/lollipop). The panel inspector's Drill-through, Detail drawer, Cross-filter, Conditional formatting, and Color scale sections now only render when the selected chart type actually supports them — e.g. a Table panel no longer shows Cross-filter/Color scale/Conditional formatting/Drill-through (previously shown for every type with zero effect), but keeps Detail drawer (table rows do support it); a Line chart no longer shows Conditional formatting or Color scale. `docs/index.html` updated with a note on the context-aware behavior. 4 new tests. Test suite 741/741.
- v139: **Z8 slice 2: table-specific options — row limit + grand total row** — `Studio.CHARTS.table.opts` gains **Row limit** (0 = all) and **Show grand total row** (sums numeric columns over the currently visible/filtered rows, appended as a bold `<tfoot>` row). `PDC.table` override in `studio-charts.js` renders the total row; `studio-render.js` applies the row limit client-side before rendering. Same code path for preview + exported CDF (studio-charts.js is inlined into exports). `docs/index.html` Table card updated. 4 new tests. Test suite 745/745.
- v140: **Z8 slice 3: Table extras — paging, freeze header, row density** — three more Table-specific options: **Rows per page** (0 = all on one page; otherwise a Prev/Next `.tbl-page-bar`), **Freeze header row** (scrollable `.tbl-wrap.frz` with `position:sticky` thead — tall tables no longer just clip at the panel edge with no way to see all rows), and **Row density** (Comfortable/Compact). Paging resets on filter/sort change; bar-cell scaling + grand total still compute over the full filtered/sorted set, not just the current page. New `optField()` "select" opt type in `studio.js` (reuses `select2pairs`) — first inspector option backed by an arbitrary choice list. `docs/index.html` updated. 4 new Z8T tests. Test suite 749/749.
- v141: **Z8 slice 4: Gauge gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.gauge.opts` gains a **Value format** picker (was always a raw rounded number) and **Warning/Good zone %** thresholds (were hardcoded 70/90 in the vendored toolkit, invisible to the builder). The gauge arc now shows a permanent red/amber/green zone track behind a bright value tick (mirrors the Bullet chart convention) instead of only recoloring once the value crosses an invisible line. `PDC.gauge` overridden in `studio-charts.js` (`PDC._gaugeBase` kept for reference); `studio-render.js` passes fmt/warnAt/goodAt through. `docs/index.html` updated. 4 new Z8G tests. Test suite 753/753.
- v142: **Z8 slice 5: Treemap gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.treemap.opts` gains **Show tile labels** (toggle off the bold title+value text the base toolkit always drew on big-enough tiles) and **Show % of total, not value** (swap the value line for the tile's share of the whole). `PDC.treemap` overridden in `studio-charts.js` (`PDC._treemapBase` kept for reference, same pattern as Table/Gauge); tooltip unaffected (still shows both value and %). `docs/index.html` updated. 5 new Z8M tests. Test suite 758/758.
- v143: **Z8 slice 6: Scatter gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.scatter.opts` gains **Value format** (axis ticks + tooltip were always `PDC.fmt.abbr`, no way to change) and **Show trend line (regression)** — an OLS regression line drawn through the plotted points. `PDC.scatter` overridden in `studio-charts.js` (`PDC._scatterBase` kept for reference, same pattern as Table/Gauge/Treemap); `studio-render.js` falls back to the chart's true `abbr` default (not the ambient plain fallback) so scatter panels saved before this option existed don't regress. `docs/index.html` updated. 4 new Z8SC tests. Test suite 762/762.
- v144: **Z8 slice 7: Line / area gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.line.opts` gains **Smooth curve** (cubic-bezier interpolation between points, same midpoint-control-point technique as the Bump chart) and **Show data points** (hide the per-point dot markers; a transparent hover target keeps tooltips working even with dots hidden). `PDC.line` overridden in `studio-charts.js` (`PDC._lineBase` kept for reference, same pattern as Table/Gauge/Treemap/Scatter); `studio-render.js` passes smooth/showDots through. `docs/index.html` updated. 3 new Z8LN tests. Test suite 765/765.
- v147: **Z8 slice 10: Stacked bars gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.stacked.opts` gains **Sort by
  total** (order categories by their stacked total, largest first, same convention as Bars/Donut) and
  **Show value labels** (per-segment value text centered in its band, shown only when the band is tall
  enough to hold it legibly). `PDC.stacked` overridden in `studio-charts.js` (`PDC._stackedBase` kept for
  reference, same pattern as Table/Gauge/Treemap/Scatter/Line/Donut/Bars); `studio-render.js` passes
  `sortStack`/`showValues` through; CDE export's `valuesVisible` now reflects the option. `docs/index.html`
  updated. 3 new Z8ST tests. Test suite 774/774.
- v148: **Z8 slice 11: Calendar heatmap gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.calHeatmap.opts` gains
  **Cell color** (was hardcoded to the brand color) and **Week starts on** (Monday/Sunday — weeks always
  rolled over from Monday before with no way to change it). `PDC.calHeatmap` in `studio-charts.js` reads
  `cfg.color`/`cfg.weekStart` (weekday labels reorder to match); `studio-render.js` passes both through
  via the existing `color()` token helper. `docs/index.html` updated. 3 new Z8-11 tests. Test suite 777/777.
- v149: **Z8 slice 12: KPI tiles get click-through** — a new "Click-through" section in every KPI
  inspector (Target URL + URL parameter) lets a tile navigate to another dashboard when clicked, giving
  KPIs the same drill-out affordance bars/donut already have via panel Drill-through. Bound with the same
  shared `PDC.bindDrill` helper directly on the `.kpi` tile element (carries the tile's raw value as the
  drill label); works in the live preview and every exported CDF (studio-render.js is inlined into
  exports, so no exporter changes needed). `docs/index.html` KPI card updated. 4 new tests. Test suite
  781/781.
- v150: **Z8 slice 13: Stacked area gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.areaStacked.opts` gains
  **Smooth curve** (cubic-bezier band edges via a new `_bandSeg` helper, same midpoint-control-point
  technique as Line/Bump) and **Show legend** (the renderer already supported hiding the legend
  internally via `cfg.legend`, but no inspector control ever exposed it). `studio-render.js` passes
  `smooth`/`legend` through to `PDC.areaStacked`. `docs/index.html` updated. 3 new Z8AS tests. Test suite
  784/784.
- v151: **Z8 slice 14: Stream graph gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.streamgraph.opts` gains
  **Show legend** (the renderer already supported hiding the legend via `cfg.legend`, but the inspector
  never exposed a toggle) and **Band opacity** (was hardcoded to 78%, now adjustable 0–100%). `PDC.streamgraph`
  reads `cfg.opacity` for the ribbon fill-opacity; `studio-render.js` passes `showLegend`/`bandOpacity`
  through. `docs/index.html` updated. 3 new Z8SG tests. Test suite 786/786.
- v146: **Z8 slice 9: Bar chart gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.bars.opts` gains **Sort by value**
  (largest-first, same convention as Donut's "Sort slices") and **Show value labels** (hide the always-on
  value text for a cleaner look on dense charts). `PDC.bars` overridden in `studio-charts.js`
  (`PDC._barsBase` kept for reference, same pattern as Table/Gauge/Treemap/Scatter/Line/Donut);
  `studio-render.js` passes `sortBars`/`showValues` through and extends `wireXFilter`'s bars branch to
  mirror the sort for cross-filter click mapping. CDE `valuesVisible` now reflects the option. `docs/index.html`
  updated. 3 new Z8BR tests. Test suite 771/771.
- v145: **Z8 slice 8: Donut gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.donut.opts` gains **Sort slices by value** (largest-first), **Show legend** (hide the side legend so the ring fills the panel), and **Inner radius %** (adjustable ring thickness, 0 = full pie). `PDC.donut` overridden in `studio-charts.js` (`PDC._donutBase` kept for reference, same pattern as Table/Gauge/Treemap/Scatter/Line); `studio-render.js` passes sortSlices/legend/innerPct through and mirrors the sort in the cross-filter click-to-label wiring (`wireXFilter`) so slice clicks still map correctly when sorted. `docs/index.html` updated. 3 new Z8DN tests. Test suite 768/768.
- v152: **Z8 slice 15: Radar / spider gets its own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.radar.opts` gains **Show legend**
  (the renderer already supported hiding the legend via `cfg.legend`, but the inspector never exposed a
  toggle) and **Show vertex dots** (hide the per-vertex dot markers for a cleaner polygon-only look;
  invisible hover targets keep tooltips working with dots hidden, same convention as Line's "Show data
  points"). `PDC.radar` in `studio-charts.js` reads `cfg.showDots`; `studio-render.js` passes
  `legend`/`showDots` through. `docs/index.html` updated. 3 new Z8RD tests. Test suite 789/789.
- v154: **Z8 slice 17: Bump + Icicle get their own options** — `Studio.CHARTS.bump.opts` gains **Show rank
  numbers in dots** (declutters a chart with many entities/periods); `Studio.CHARTS.icicle.opts` gains
  **Show cell labels** + **Show % of total, not value**, mirroring Treemap's pattern (both are
  proportional-area partitions). These were the last two chart types with zero distinguishing options
  beyond fmt+height — every chart type now has at least one type-specific option. `PDC.bump`/`PDC.icicle`
  updated directly in `studio-charts.js` (both are pure extensions, no vendored base); `studio-render.js`
  passes the new keys through. 4 new Z8BI tests. Test suite 796/796.
- v155: **Z8 slice 18 (Z8 track complete): Grouped bars + 100% stacked get their own options** — the v154
  audit missed that `groupedBars`/`barNorm` were still on bare rotate+fmt+height (rotate is a generic
  option shared by many types, not a distinguishing one). `Studio.CHARTS.groupedBars.opts` gains **Show
  value labels** (formatted value above each bar, drawn only when wide enough); `Studio.CHARTS.barNorm.opts`
  gains **Show segment % labels** (rounded `NN%` centered in each band, drawn only when tall+wide enough).
  `PDC.groupedBars`/`PDC.barNorm` updated in `studio-charts.js`; labels fade in with their bar/segment's
  entrance animation; `studio-render.js` passes the new keys through; `docs/index.html` updated. Every
  chart type now genuinely carries at least one type-specific option. 4 new Z8GN tests. Test suite 800/800.
- v156: **Z13: new showcase example — "Data Platform Operations Center"** (`data/examples/ops-command.studio.json`),
  an 8-panel dashboard covering **8 chart types not used in any other bundled example**: Sankey (pipeline
  flow), Network (system→app dependency graph), Quadrant (risk vs. volume), Calendar heatmap (daily
  reliability), Bump (stage-runtime ranking over months), Sunburst (assets by source), Waffle (job outcome
  mix), Pareto (errors by source). Placed second in the gallery order (existing lead example unchanged, so
  the "most-spectacular-first, no single hero" regression test stays meaningful). `docs/index.html` example
  count corrected 6→7. 3 new Z13 tests (listed in bundle, all 8 types present, every panel renders real
  content). Test suite 803/803.
- v157: **Z13: 8th showcase example — "Product Delivery & Engineering Console"** (`data/examples/
  engineering-delivery.studio.json`), an 8-panel dashboard covering **8 more chart types not used in any
  other bundled example**: Table (backlog queue), Combo (velocity vs. defects), Grouped bars (points by
  team), Stacked bars (ticket mix by team), Dumbbell (planned vs. actual), Histogram (cycle time), Timeline
  (release milestones), Word cloud (tool mentions). Gallery coverage now 29/51 types. Also fixed a real,
  previously-latent bug found while validating the new histogram panel: `PDC.histogram`'s bar entrance
  animation used the invalid SVG-attribute syntax `setAttribute("transform","scaleY(0)")` (`scaleY()` is a
  CSS transform function, not part of the SVG transform-attribute dialect) — switched to `.style.transform`
  (CSS), matching every other animated chart. `docs/index.html` example count corrected 7→8. 3 new Z13
  tests. Test suite 806/806.
- v158: **Z13: 9th showcase example — "Finance & FP&A Command Center"** (`data/examples/
  finance-command.studio.json`), an 8-panel dashboard covering **8 more chart types not used in any other
  bundled example**: Candlestick (monthly revenue range), Area range (forecast confidence band), Diverging
  bars (budget variance by department), Radial bar (KPI attainment ranking), Icicle (two-level cost
  breakdown — first bundled use of icicle's `groupCol`), Chord (inter-department fund transfers), Parallel
  coordinates (regional performance profiles), Gantt (month-end close timeline). Gallery coverage now
  37/51 types. Found and fixed a real, previously-latent bug: the `icicle` case in `studio-render.js` read
  a bare `groupCol` identifier (undefined) instead of `m.groupCol`, so any icicle panel with a group column
  configured threw `ReferenceError` and rendered nothing — nothing had exercised two-level icicle until this
  example. Also added a `signed` classify kind to `app/sampledata.js` (variance/delta/diff/change column
  names → alternating +/- values) so diverging-bar-style panels actually diverge in the offline preview.
  `docs/index.html` example count corrected 8→9. 3 new Z13 tests. Test suite 809/809.
- v159: **Z13: 10th showcase example — "Marketing & Growth Performance Console"** (`data/examples/
  marketing-growth.studio.json`), a 10-panel dashboard covering **the last 10 non-distribution-limited
  chart types**: Streamgraph (channel traffic), Slope (campaign CTR before/after), Dot plot (planned vs.
  actual budget), Polar area (ad spend share), Step (subscriber tier migration), Marimekko (revenue mix),
  Packed bubbles (audience size), Population pyramid (age/gender split), 100% stacked bars (creative
  format mix), and Text/annotation (a guided intro panel). Gallery coverage now **47/51 types** — every
  chart type except boxplot/violin/ridgeline/beeswarm, which need a sample-data-generator change (see NEXT
  below) before they'll look like real distributions. Fixed the generic "all examples render every panel"
  Playwright check, which only counted `svg`/`table` elements — a richtext panel renders a `.sr-richtext`
  div instead, so the very first example using one would have silently failed; widened the selector rather
  than special-casing the new example. `docs/index.html` example count corrected 9→10. 3 new Z13 tests.
  Test suite 812/812.

### ★ Z. Analytics App platform — the new north star (user-requested 2026-06-30; build across many iterations)
> The studio is becoming a multi-section **analytics application**, not just a dashboard builder.
> Build this incrementally — one small, shippable, tested slice per loop. Keep it pure HTML/JS with all
> config saved **locally** (localStorage / file import-export); **NO backend/database/app-server for now**
> (revisit only if truly forced). Aesthetic: **fun, clean, elegant, a little game-like** (not corny) —
> "almost game-like in its fun-ness."

**Design language (pulled from polecat.live / app.polecat.live):**
- Warm-dark base: plum-black `#2E2A33` / `#3A2F3A` / `#0a0a0f` backgrounds, cream `#F5E9D6` text.
- Primary accent terracotta `#d4773b` / `#f55036`; playful multi-accent set for section icons:
  violet `#8b5cf6`, blue `#4285f4`, teal `#10a37f`, amber `#ffb000`, salmon `#F4A6A6`, bronze `#9C6B3F`.
- System font stack. Each left-rail section gets ONE accent color (single-color icon). Tasteful motion
  (respect `prefers-reduced-motion`); keep the existing light/dark toggle.

**Z1 — App shell with a collapsible left rail.** ✓ slice 1 shipped v132: `app/shell.js` + rail markup in
`index.html`. Vertical left nav of single-color icons (amber Home / teal Repository / blue Studio /
violet Settings); collapses to icons-only, expands to icon+label; persists collapsed/expanded + active
section in localStorage; roving ↑/↓ keyboard nav + `aria-current` a11y. **The rail WRAPS the Studio — it
does not replace the Studio's panes**: the existing 3-pane layout (Data Source Library · canvas ·
Inspector) is untouched inside the Studio section (wrapped in `#appMain`, zero feature loss). So there
are two nested "lefts" by design: the outer app-shell nav rail (section switcher) and, within Studio, the
existing library pane. Home/Repository/Settings currently show "coming soon" placeholders — real content
is Z2/Z3/Z5 below. Scoped to desktop for now: rail hidden ≤900px, Studio always wins on narrow viewports,
so mobile/tablet is completely unaffected (see Z9 for the dedicated mobile track). 8 new tests, suite
713/713.
> **Z1 follow-ups (not yet done):** richer motion (panel slide-in, selection transitions — collapse/expand
> already animates); **simplify the TOP menu bar** now that the rail owns primary navigation — reorganize
> to consistent, best-practice IA (logical grouping, no redundancy, clear labels/icons: rail = "where am
> I", top bar = "what can I do here"); extend the rail to tablet width once Home/Repository/Settings have
> real content worth navigating to on a smaller screen.

**Z2 — Home.** ✓ slice 1 shipped v133: quick-create cards (Blank / Browse examples / Take the tour) +
a "Recent dashboards" grid, each card a live SVG thumbnail (`Studio.makeThumbnail`) that genuinely
reopens the exact dashboard (full spec captured on the auto-save debounce path, capped at 8,
`localStorage["studio-recents"]`). **Z2 follow-ups (not yet done):** favorites/pinning, folders/
organization, branding area, more lively motion + hover life on the cards (currently a simple lift +
border-glow), instructions/how-tos/tips beyond the existing tour link.

**Z3 — Repository (Data Sources + Workbooks).** One "repository" holding **data-source definitions** and
**workbook definitions** (a workbook = a named collection of HTML dashboards). Browse/search/organize into
folders; CRUD; stored locally; import/export the whole repository as JSON. Consolidates the old "data
source library" and "dashboard inventory" ideas into one place.

**Z14 — Browser-native, file-hosted SQL engines: DuckDB-Wasm + SQLite-WASM-HTTP (user-requested 2026-07-02).**
> ★ **PRIORITY: build this connector track BEFORE the Z4 warehouse providers** (user-requested 2026-07-02).
> These are backend-free, so they ship real querying without waiting on tokens/proxies/CORS — do Z14's
> slices first, then return to Z4 (Snowflake/Databricks/BigQuery).
Two connectors that query a **static file hosted on S3 / any HTTP host directly from the browser** — no
backend, no proxy, no credentials, no CORS token dance. This is the **first non-CDA connector track** (ahead
of Z4) because it fits our "pure HTML/JS, config saved locally, NO backend" constraint perfectly (unlike
Snowflake/Databricks/BigQuery, which need tokens and usually a thin proxy — those come later in Z4). Both work
by turning the engine's file reads into **HTTP Range Requests**, pulling only the bytes a query needs. Build
as two connector types in the Z3/Z4 Data-Source model; one shippable slice per loop; add Playwright checks.
- **Option 1 — DuckDB-Wasm (analytics / dashboards, our sweet spot).** Load the DuckDB-Wasm library, point it
  at a remote `.parquet` (columnar, compressed) or `.csv` URL, and run standard SQL against it. DuckDB does
  HTTP Range Requests under the hood — reads file metadata + only the columns a query touches, so it scans
  millions of rows / runs aggregations over a large remote file while transferring little. **Best fit for our
  chart/aggregation workload.** Connector config: file URL(s) (parquet/csv), optional table alias, a **Test
  connection** (HEAD/first-range probe + `DESCRIBE`), column detection from the file schema. A query authored
  here feeds the same dashboard model as any other data access.
- **Option 2 — SQLite-WASM + HTTP VFS (relational, indexed lookups).** For a traditional relational DB with
  indexes / PKs / complex joins: ship a prebuilt `.sqlite` file to S3 and query it with `sql.js-httpvfs` /
  `sqlite-wasm-http`, which intercept SQLite's disk reads and turn them into HTTP Range Requests. Because
  SQLite is a B-Tree, an indexed query downloads only the specific ~4 KB pages it needs — a lookup on a 1 GB
  DB can transfer a few KB. **Best fit for read-heavy relational apps / instant row lookups** without an RDS.
  Connector config: `.sqlite` URL, optional `serverMode`/page config, **Test connection** + schema
  introspection (`sqlite_master`), column detection.
- Cross-cutting: both are **light, self-contained** (lazy-load the wasm engine only when such a connector is
  used, so the base app stays tiny and dependency-free); surface clear errors when the host doesn't support
  Range Requests (`Accept-Ranges`) or CORS; note file-size/first-load cost; keep credentials out entirely
  (public/pre-signed URLs). Show them in the connector gallery with logos alongside the Z4 providers.
- Sequence (one slice each): (1) DuckDB-Wasm connector: config form + lazy loader + Test + column detect +
  query→model; (2) parquet & csv coverage + aggregation smoke test; (3) SQLite-WASM-HTTP connector: config +
  loader + Test + schema introspect; (4) polish — error surfacing, connector-gallery cards/logos, docs.

**Z4 — Data Source library + connectors.** Expand beyond CDA to direct querying of leading providers,
browser-only via each provider's REST/SQL API with locally-saved credentials. Priority connectors:
**Snowflake** (SQL REST API), **Databricks** (SQL Statement Execution API), **BigQuery + cloud
warehouses** (Redshift/Synapse as APIs allow), **generic SQL/HTTP**, and **keep Pentaho CDA** as one
connector among many. Per provider: a config form (account/host/warehouse/token/etc.), a **Test
connection** button, and **brand logos** — make the connector gallery sexy. Note CORS/security realities
(some providers need a token or a thin proxy); surface clear errors. A query authored against any
connector feeds the same dashboard model.
> **START HERE → do Z14 (immediately above) FIRST**: **DuckDB-Wasm** and **SQLite-WASM-HTTP** query a static
> file over HTTP Range Requests with **no backend/proxy/credentials**, so they're the prioritized first
> connectors. Build all of Z14's slices before the token-gated warehouse providers in this Z4 entry.

**Z5 — Settings.** App configuration: theme, default deploy target, gate/access, data-source defaults,
and **dashboard style defaults** (standard look/style applied to new dashboards). Support **collections
of named style presets** the user can pick from. Export/import settings as JSON.
> ✓ **Slice 1 shipped v135: mode toggles as first-class, discoverable controls.** The Settings section
> (left rail) now shows **Dark mode**, **Simple mode**, **Demo mode**, and **Focus mode** as labelled
> on/off switches (Appearance / Mode / Presentation cards) — each a thin wrapper over the existing mode
> function (single source of truth, stays in sync with the ⋯ More menu, which is unchanged/still present).
> 6 new Z5 tests, suite 729/729.
> ✓ **Settings export/import as JSON shipped v136**: a "Data" card on the Settings page exports theme/mode/
> connections/layout preferences to `dashboard-studio-settings.json` and imports them back (confirmed before
> applying; dashboard content itself is untouched — still Save/Open).
> **Z5 follow-ups (not yet done):** deploy target config, gate/access management, data-source defaults,
> dashboard style-preset collections, and the optional polecat.live-style left-drawer mirror of key toggles.

**Z6 — Banner / header editor + naming model (user-requested; refined 2026-06-30).** Make the dashboard
header/banner (the "Cost Optimization & Sustainability · subtitle" bar in the preview) fully **editable
in-app** — title, subtitle, logo, colors, links, and full text formatting. Add **default headers** as
named presets defined in **Settings** (default colors/logo/formatting); when building a dashboard, offer
an **"include default header"** option that drops the preset in, then let the user **edit it per-dashboard**
with all formatting. Consider **integrating the header with the ¶ Text/annotation element** — the header
could be a special rich-text block (or the text element gains header-style options) so one editor covers
both. Tie into the Z5 style-preset collections. **Also reconsider the ¶ Text button's placement** — it sits
on the Live-preview/canvas bar and reads as cluttered/odd there; fold "add text/annotation" into a cleaner
add-element affordance (e.g. the **New / ＋** flow or an on-canvas insert), consistent with how panels are
added, and unified with this header/text-object work.
> **Naming model (relocate title editing).** Editing the dashboard name up in the **top bar** (`#dashTitle`)
> now feels out of place with the app shell — move name editing into the **panel/inspector and/or Settings**,
> not the topbar chip. Also separate the two names that are currently conflated: the **object/file name**
> (the stem, e.g. `studio-cost`, used for exports/repository) vs the **dashboard display title** (e.g.
> "Cost Optimization & Sustainability", shown in the header/banner) — they should be independently editable
> fields. Coordinate with the Z1 top-bar cleanup and the Z3 Repository (where objects are named/organized).

**Z7 — Analytics: forecasting + statistical functions.** Move toward standalone analytic apps: add
forecasting (moving average, exponential smoothing / Holt-Winters, linear & seasonal trend) and
statistical functions/variations (regression, percentiles, z-scores, correlation, distributions) as
chart options / derived series / KPI computations. Keep it light (vanilla-JS math, no heavy deps).

**Z8 — Context-aware inspector (per chart type) + visual setting hints (user-requested 2026-06-30).**
The panel inspector currently shows ALL setting sections regardless of chart type — e.g. a **Table**
panel shows chart-only sections (Callout Arrow, Color Scale, the area-band Top/Bottom-edge + Fill, etc.)
that don't apply. Make the inspector **adapt to the selected chart type**: show only relevant sections,
hide the rest, and add type-specific options where they're missing. Build a per-type capability map so
each chart type declares which inspector sections apply + its own extras. Examples: a **Table** should
have row limit, paging / page size, sort, column **subtotals / grand total**, freeze header, and row
density — but none of the callout/colour-scale/band controls. **Do this comprehensively for EVERY chart
type, not just tables** — go through all ~51 types and give each its own relevant section set plus any
missing type-specific options (e.g. KPIs, treemaps, line/area, scatter, gauge, sankey, calendar-heatmap
each surface only what applies to them). The goal is a much easier-to-consume, self-explanatory inspector.
Also, with so many settings now, add a small **inline visual hint** for each setting — a
tiny graphic / icon / before↔after thumbnail showing what it does — to make the dense inspector
self-explanatory. Keep it light (inline SVG / CSS, no image assets or deps). One slice per loop; tests green.
> ✓ **Slice 1 shipped v138**: `Studio.ANNOT_CAPS` capability map (+ `Studio.chartSupports(kind, type)`)
> now gates the 5 interaction sections whose usefulness genuinely varies by chart type — Drill-through
> (bars/donut only), Detail drawer (bars/donut/treemap/table), Cross-filter, Conditional formatting, and
> Color scale (bars/donut/treemap/lollipop) — hidden entirely when the selected type doesn't support them.
> Period highlight/Event markers/Point annotations were already type-gated (pre-Z8); Target line/Reference
> band/Callout arrow remain type-agnostic overlays (genuinely apply to any chart body) and are unchanged.
> ✓ **Slice 2 shipped v139**: Table gained its own `opts` — **Row limit** (cap rows shown, 0 = all) and
> **Show grand total row** (bold `<tfoot>` summing numeric columns over the currently visible/filtered
> rows). Table already had search/sort/stripes (v113).
> ✓ **Slice 3 shipped v140**: the rest of the "Table extras" wishlist — **paging** (rows-per-page +
> Prev/Next bar), **freeze header** (sticky thead in a scrollable wrap), and **row density**
> (comfortable/compact). Table's own option set is now feature-complete per the original wishlist.
> ✓ **Slice 4 shipped v141**: **Gauge** gets its own options — a **Value format** picker (was always a
> raw rounded number) and **Warning/Good zone %** thresholds (were hardcoded 70/90 in the vendored
> toolkit, invisible to the builder). The arc now shows a permanent red/amber/green zone track behind
> the value tick (same convention as Bullet), so thresholds are self-explanatory instead of only implied
> by the needle recoloring once it crosses an invisible line.
> ✓ **Slice 5 shipped v142**: **Treemap** gets its own options — **Show tile labels** (toggle off the
> bold title+value text the toolkit always drew on any big-enough tile) and **Show % of total, not
> value** (swap the value line for the tile's share of the whole — usually the actual question a
> treemap answers). Tooltip unaffected (still shows both). Same override pattern as Table/Gauge
> (`PDC._treemapBase` kept for reference).
> ✓ **Slice 6 shipped v143**: **Scatter / bubble** gets its own options — **Value format** (axis ticks +
> tooltip were always `PDC.fmt.abbr`) and **Show trend line (regression)** (least-squares regression
> line through the plotted points, clamped to the visible axis range). Same override pattern
> (`PDC._scatterBase` kept for reference); fmtX/fmtY fall back to true `abbr` default for panels saved
> before this option existed, so no existing dashboard regresses.
> ✓ **Slice 7 shipped v144**: **Line / area** gets its own options — **Smooth curve** (cubic-bezier
> interpolation between points instead of straight segments, same midpoint-control-point technique as
> the Bump chart) and **Show data points** (hide the per-point dot markers for a cleaner look on dense
> series; a transparent hover target keeps tooltips working even with dots hidden). Same override
> pattern (`PDC._lineBase` kept for reference).
> ✓ **Slice 8 shipped v145**: **Donut / pie** gets its own options — **Sort slices by value**
> (largest-first instead of row order), **Show legend** (hide the side legend so the ring fills the
> panel), and **Inner radius %** (adjustable ring thickness, 0 = full pie with no center hole/label).
> Same override pattern (`PDC._donutBase` kept for reference); cross-filter's click-to-label wiring
> (`wireXFilter` in studio-render.js) mirrors the sort so slice clicks still map to the right label.
> ✓ **Slice 9 shipped v146**: **Bar chart** gets its own options — **Sort by value** (largest-first,
> mirrors Donut's "Sort slices") and **Show value labels** (hide the always-on value text for a cleaner
> look on dense charts). Same override pattern (`PDC._barsBase` kept for reference); `wireXFilter`'s bars
> branch now mirrors the sort too, and CDE export's `valuesVisible` reflects the option.
> ✓ **Slice 10 shipped v147**: **Stacked bars** gets its own options — **Sort by total** (largest-first,
> mirrors Bars/Donut) and **Show value labels** (per-segment value text, shown only when the band is tall
> enough). Same override pattern (`PDC._stackedBase` kept for reference); CDE export's `valuesVisible`
> reflects the option.
> ✓ **Slice 11 shipped v148**: **Calendar heatmap** gets its own options — **Cell color** (was hardcoded
> to the brand color) and **Week starts on** (Monday/Sunday — weeks always rolled over from Monday
> before). Same per-type override pattern; weekday labels reorder to match the chosen start day.
> ✓ **Slice 12 shipped v149**: **KPI tiles** get a "Click-through" section (Target URL + URL parameter) —
> click a tile to navigate to another dashboard, using the same shared `PDC.bindDrill` helper bars/donut
> already use for Drill-through. First KPI-specific inspector addition under Z8.
> ✓ **Slice 13 shipped v150**: **Stacked area** gets its own options — **Smooth curve** (cubic-bezier
> band edges, same technique as Line/Bump) and **Show legend** (the renderer already supported hiding the
> legend via `cfg.legend`; the inspector never exposed a toggle until now).
> ✓ **Slice 14 shipped v151**: **Stream graph** gets its own options — **Show legend** (same story as
> Stacked area — the renderer already supported `cfg.legend` but nothing exposed it) and **Band opacity**
> (ribbon fill-opacity was hardcoded to 78%, now a 0–100% slider).
> ✓ **Slice 15 shipped v152**: **Radar / spider** gets its own options — **Show legend** (same story as
> Stacked area/Stream graph — `cfg.legend` was already supported internally but never exposed) and
> **Show vertex dots** (hide the per-vertex dot markers; invisible hover targets keep tooltips working,
> same convention as Line's "Show data points").
> ✓ **Slice 16 shipped v153**: **Chord / wheel** and **Network / topology** get their own options — both
> gain a **Show labels** toggle (arc labels for Chord, node labels for Network) to declutter a dense
> diagram. These were the last two Flow-group types still on generic fmt+height only; sankey already had
> its own source/destination captions (v55), waterfall/funnel/sunburst/combo already had type-specific
> options too (showTotal/showPct/showLabels/dual-axis fmt) so the actual gap was just these two.
> ✓ **Slice 17 shipped v154**: **Bump / ranking** gets **Show rank numbers in dots** and **Icicle /
> partition** gets **Show cell labels** + **Show % of total, not value** (mirrors Treemap's pattern) —
> the last two chart types still on bare fmt+height with zero distinguishing options. Audited every
> type's `opts` array to confirm: bars/donut/stacked/lollipop/dumbbell/slope/dotplot/beeswarm/histogram/
> polarArea/step/violin/marimekko/packedBubble/wordCloud/gantt/divergingBar/candlestick/waffle/timeline/
> pyramidBar/radialBar/pareto/groupedBars/ridgeline/barNorm/areaRange/quadrant/waterfall/funnel/sunburst/
> combo/bullet/sankey all already carry at least one genuine type-specific option alongside fmt+height.
> ✓ **Slice 18 shipped v155 (per-type option sweep now genuinely complete)**: **Grouped bars** gets
> **Show value labels** and **100% stacked bars** gets **Show segment % labels** — the v154 audit had
> miscounted these two as already-done because `rotate` (a generic option shared by many bar-family
> types) isn't actually type-specific. Every chart type now carries at least one real type-specific
> option beyond fmt+height.
> **Z8 follow-ups (not yet done):** the inline visual setting hints (tiny before/after thumbnails) for
> the now-dense inspector remain open — the largest remaining piece of the original Z8 ask.

**Z9 — Mobile: fix the broken flows + a proper bottom nav (user-requested 2026-06-30).** Reported
regressions on small screens: the top button-bar scrolls/slides but **its dropdown menus don't open /
work** — fix that first (touch handlers, menu positioning, tap-outside-to-close). Add a **bottom
navigation** to switch between the Studio's **data-source / canvas / chart-object (inspector)** views on
phones (the three panes become swipeable/tabbed sections). Coordinate with the Z1 shell so the left rail
collapses into a sensible mobile pattern (bottom bar or hamburger sheet). Use **modern flows and
animations** — drawer/sheet motion, tab transitions, momentum — smooth, elegant, and modern (respect
prefers-reduced-motion). Verify with the mobile Playwright checks and ADD a regression test for
"dropdown opens on touch". (There is an older mobile track (B) too — this supersedes/extends it with the
specific bugs + the new-shell mobile behavior.)
> ✓ **Root cause of the "dropdown menus don't open" report found + fixed, shipped v137**: at **tablet
> widths (641–900px)**, `#topbar`/`.top-actions` need `overflow:hidden` to stop the button row from
> forcing page-level horizontal scroll — but that same clip box was also hiding every dropdown (New ▾ /
> Examples ▾ / Export ▾ / ⋯ More), since `.menu` is `position:absolute` and extends below the topbar's
> own box. The menu still gained the `.open` class and reported normal computed styles, so it looked
> fine to a DOM check (and to Playwright's default click/tap actionability check) while being genuinely
> invisible/untappable on screen — confirmed visually via screenshot before fixing. Extended the same
> `position:fixed` escape hatch already used at ≤640px (phone) to the tablet range too, anchored under
> its button. Added an `elementFromPoint`-based regression test (the only kind that actually catches
> ancestor-overflow clipping — `.classList.contains("open")` alone does not) for New/Export/More at a
> tablet viewport; confirmed it fails without the fix and passes with it. **Still open under Z9**: the
> bottom-nav/drawer pattern already exists at phone width (M2, `#mobile-tabs`); modern
> motion/transition polish and a live-device pass across the true 641–900px tablet band remain.

**Z10 — App theme system: theme × light/dark (user-requested 2026-06-30).** The new Polecat warm-dark
rail (Z1) currently **clashes** with the Studio's original "classic blue" chrome + dark mode — two
palettes on screen at once. Introduce a real **theme system in Settings**, not a one-off recolor: a small
set of named color themes (e.g. **Classic Blue**, **Polecat** (warm plum/terracotta/cream), room for
more), each defined as a **coherent set of CSS custom properties** with BOTH a **light** and a **dark**
variant. The current dark mode becomes "Classic Blue · Dark"; **Polecat gets its own warm-dark** (plum/
charcoal bg, cream text, terracotta accents) — more visually pleasing and on-brand than the cool-blue
dark. Apply via `data-theme` + `data-mode` on the root so the **rail, top bar, panels, and all chrome
derive from the active theme together** (keep the per-section rail icon accents vivid). Persist theme+mode
in localStorage; the existing **Dark/Light** button becomes the **mode** toggle *within* the active theme.
Design decision to surface: whether the **exported dashboard** theme follows the app theme or stays
independent — recommend keeping export theming **separate/optional** so deployed artifacts aren't coupled
to app chrome. Build incrementally (theme tokens first, then the Polecat dark variant, then the Settings
picker); tests green. Coordinate with Z1 (rail) and Z5 (Settings).

**Z11 — In-app docs: discoverability + continuous upkeep (user-requested 2026-06-30).** ✓ **Rail Help
entry shipped v136**: a persistent `#railHelp` link at the bottom of the left rail opens `docs/index.html`
in a new tab — no longer buried solely in ⋯ More (which still has its own entry too). Contextual `.sec-help`/
`.ct-help` links (J2/J4) already exist per-section/per-chart-type. **Still open:** style `docs/index.html`
to match the active app theme (it's currently a fixed light Pentaho-style doc, independent of the app's
dark/Polecat theme — may be fine as a deliberately neutral reference, revisit once Z10 theme system lands);
keep treating docs as a living reference (standing responsibility, see Conventions).

**Z12 — Branding & app identity: de-dup the logo, favicon, Settings option (user-requested; revised 2026-06-30).**
Design direction (best practice — the user wants it clean, not a redundant single letter):
- ✓ **Remove the redundant "P" square from the app title / content header** — shipped v134: topbar now
  leads with the styled wordmark alone.
- ✓ **Anchor app identity at the TOP of the left rail** — shipped v134: `#railBrand` (favicon-glyph mark +
  "Dashboard Studio" label, collapses to just the mark, click → Home).
- ✓ **Favicon** — shipped v134: `favicon.svg` (terracotta-gradient bar-chart mark) + `apple-touch-icon` +
  `site.webmanifest` + `theme-color`. Note: `apple-touch-icon` points at the SVG (no PNG rasterizer in this
  toolchain) — iOS home-screen icons may not render until a real PNG variant is generated; revisit if that
  matters in practice.
- **Make branding a Settings option (Z5).** Still open — a small **Branding** area: choose the default mark,
  upload a custom logo, or "none" — so identity isn't hardcoded and can flex in the future. Ties to the
  Z5/Z6 style presets. Blocked on Z5 (Settings) having real content to host it in. Light-weight, no build
  step; taste over cleverness.

**Z13 — Curated showcase examples: make them a COMPLETE, dazzling survey (user-requested 2026-06-30,
expanded).** Done so far: replaced the 17 legacy v2 boards with 6 curated examples; gallery glow-up (real
per-chart thumbnails, no CDF/CDE badges); one grid ordered **most-spectacular-first, no single hero**;
fixed KPI/gauge NaN/`0`/double-`%` (sample-data generator + example gauges).
> ✓ **7th example shipped v156**: "Data Platform Operations Center" (`ops-command.studio.json`, second in
> gallery order) covers **8 previously-missing types in one dashboard**: sankey, network, quadrant,
> calHeatmap, bump, sunburst, waffle, pareto. Gotcha learned along the way (worth remembering for future
> examples): `app/sampledata.js`'s `classify()` checks the **"name" keyword group before "count"** —
> a column literally named `job_count` gets misclassified as a **name** (string) column because it
> contains "job", producing non-numeric values and a silent "No data" empty state; renaming to e.g.
> `run_count` avoids the collision. Always sanity-check a new example's `Studio.genMock(spec)` output
> per DA before shipping, not just that panels render *something*.
> ✓ **8th example shipped v157**: "Product Delivery & Engineering Console" (`engineering-delivery.studio.json`,
> third in gallery order) covers **8 more previously-missing types**: table, combo, groupedBars, stacked,
> dumbbell, histogram, timeline, wordCloud. Gotcha learned along the way: any column name containing
> `day`/`date`/`period`/`month` classifies as the **"month" kind** (returns text like "Jan") even when the
> chart needs a real number (e.g. a histogram's numeric `valueCol`) — a column called `cycle_time_days`
> silently breaks a histogram; renamed to `cycle_time_hrs` to keep it numeric. Also confirmed (not a bug,
> just a known cosmetic limit): `sampleRows` always emits exactly 8 rows with **8 distinct** categorical
> labels, so any chart that groups multiple raw values per label for its visual (boxplot's quartile box,
> beeswarm's per-category jitter, violin/ridgeline's KDE curve) will only ever see **one value per group**
> in the offline preview — it renders without error but looks degenerate (a flat line, not a real spread).
> That's why boxplot/violin/ridgeline/beeswarm were skipped this round; a real fix would need the sample
> generator to support multiple rows per label, which is a separate, larger slice.
> ✓ **9th example shipped v158**: "Finance & FP&A Command Center" (`finance-command.studio.json`, fourth in
> gallery order) covers **8 more previously-missing types**: candlestick, areaRange, divergingBar,
> radialBar, icicle, chord, parallelCoords, gantt. Found + fixed a real latent bug: the `icicle` case in
> `studio-render.js` read a bare undefined `groupCol` instead of `m.groupCol`, so any icicle panel with a
> group column threw and rendered nothing — nothing had exercised two-level icicle mode until this example.
> `sampledata.js` gained a `signed` classify kind (variance/delta/diff/change column names) so diverging
> metrics actually diverge in the offline preview.
> ✓ **10th example shipped v159 — the "easy" batch is complete**: "Marketing & Growth Performance Console"
> (`marketing-growth.studio.json`, fifth in gallery order) covers the **last 10 non-distribution-limited
> types**: streamgraph, richtext (text/annotation), slope, dotplot, polarArea, step, marimekko,
> packedBubble, pyramidBar, barNorm. Fixed the generic "all examples render every panel" Playwright check,
> which only counted `svg`/`table` as evidence of render — a richtext panel renders a `.sr-richtext` div
> instead, now included in that selector. Gallery chart-type coverage is now **47 of 51**.
NEXT — turn the examples into a **broad, complete survey of everything the app can do**, built
**progressively simple → dazzling**:
- **Cover EVERY chart type at least once** across the set — each example featuring several types the
  others don't, so the collection is a full tour. Currently covered (47 of 51): areaRange, areaStacked,
  bars, barNorm, bullet, bump, calHeatmap, candlestick, chord, combo, divergingBar, donut, dotplot,
  dumbbell, funnel, gantt, gauge, groupedBars, heatmap, histogram, icicle, line, lollipop, marimekko,
  network, packedBubble, parallelCoords, pareto, polarArea, pyramidBar, quadrant, radar, radialBar,
  richtext, sankey, scatter, slope, stacked, step, streamgraph, sunburst, table, timeline, treemap, waffle,
  waterfall, wordCloud. **Still missing (4, all share the same generator limitation):** boxplot, violin,
  ridgeline, beeswarm — `sampleRows` always emits exactly 8 rows with 8 distinct categorical labels, so any
  chart needing multiple raw values per group (quartile box, KDE curve, per-category jitter) only ever sees
  **one value per group** in the offline preview — it renders without error but looks degenerate (a flat
  line/point, not a real spread). The fix needs either an opt-in "multiple rows per label" sample-generator
  mode, or a hand-authored fixed dataset for just those 4 example panels instead of the usual synthetic
  path. This is the one real slice of work left to finish Z13's "every chart type" goal — worth its own
  loop rather than squeezing it in.
- **Show EVERY interaction/feature at least once**: **filters** (dashboard filters + the `#hash` deep-link),
  **cross-filter**, **drill-through / detail drawer** (internal drill AND cross-dashboard drill), and all
  the **marks/annotations** — target lines, reference bands, callout arrows, period highlights, event
  markers, conditional formatting, color scales, KPI compare/sparkline. Each capability demonstrated in a
  showcase, ideally called out in the panel subtitle so it reads as a guided tour.
- **Progressive complexity**: keep a couple of simple “start here” boards, then ramp to the most complex,
  fully-annotated, cross-drilling, drawer-rich dashboards — really dazzle at the top of the list.
- Ordering: keep the gallery **most-spectacular-first** (index.json order); no single hero card.
- Each example: self-contained `.studio.json` on the existing catalog data, KPIs + panels, added to
  `data/examples/index.json`, and MUST pass the "all examples render every panel" test. Validate fast with
  `node tools/export.js <spec> /tmp/x /public`, then the suite. NOTE on sample data: KPI/gauge queries are
  value-only (first column kept numeric); chart queries put a categorical **label column first**; name
  numeric columns to hit the right synthetic kind (`*_pct/rate/coverage/score`→0–100, `count/runs/rows`→counts).
Loose end: `tools/import-v2.py` still regenerates the retired `cde-*` boards + overwrites `index.json` —
update it so a regen doesn't clobber the curated gallery (repoint it at / make it additive to the set).
Consider a small defensive fix so a gauge never double-prints its unit when `fmt:"pct"` is also set.

**Z0 — Finish the terminology migration (Phase 2, started 2026-06-30).** Done so far: user-facing
CDA→"Data Access", CDF→"Dashboard Framework"; CDE export removed from the menu/inspector/bundle/push/CLI;
tour/docs/brand updated. Remaining cleanup (one safe slice per loop, keep tests green): delete the now-
unused CDE exporter code (`exportCDE` / `CDE_OK` / `cdeEmittable` / `brandHeaderRows` in exporters.js)
plus its 4 direct unit tests; relabel the Examples gallery "CDE" track badge; finish renaming remaining
user-visible CDF/CDE/CDA strings in `docs/index.html` and inspector/library labels. Keep internal
identifiers, file extensions (`.cda`/`.html`), the `.cdfde` import path, and Pentaho server connectivity intact.

### A. CDA authoring — the big track (user-requested; build across iterations, CDF stays primary)
> Slices 1–7 shipped in v31–v37. Continue with 8 below, one shippable slice/loop.
Goal: a sophisticated, assisted, user-friendly **CDA data-source builder** — define/manage the
queries behind dashboards across every CDA type, with rich preview, calculations, joins & filters.
Best practice: model a first-class `spec.cda` (connections[] + dataAccesses[] + compound) and make the
library pane + a new “Data source” inspector edit it; exporters already emit `.cda`, so authoring just
needs a real editor over the model. Sequence (one shippable slice per loop):
  1. ✓ **CDA model + library CRUD** — shipped v31.
  2. ✓ **Connections manager for CDA** — shipped v32.
  3. ✓ **Per-kind query editors** — shipped v33 (SQL/MDX/Kettle/Metadata/Scripting all have type-aware UI + correct CDA XML).
  4. ✓ **Assisted column + parameter tooling** — shipped v34 (calculated columns UI + CDA export; param type in inspector; COLUMN_TYPES constant).
  5. ✓ **Joins / compound data access** — shipped v35 (join/union builder; exportCDA + parseCDA round-trip; compound DA inspector).
  6. ✓ **Output options (filter/sort/limit)** — shipped v36 (filter rules with 8 operators; sort rules; row limit; CDA OutputOptions XML; genMock applies rules).
  7. ✓ **Sophisticated preview** — shipped v37 (param inputs, paging, column type badges, row count, Copy-as-TSV, optional live doQuery).
  8. ✓ **`.cda` round-trip parity** — shipped v38: all connection types, all DA kinds, calcColumns, outputOptions, connections[] propagation; 15 new tests.

### B. Mobile & touch friendliness — the second big track (user-requested; build across iterations)
Goal: the **builder** is usable and pleasant on phones/tablets, and **exported CDF/CDE dashboards**
render responsively. Observed today (iPhone screenshot): desktop 3-pane IDE is forced onto a phone —
topbar brand truncates/overlaps the action buttons, the collapsed Query Library + Inspector rails eat
horizontal space, no drag-by-touch, modals aren't full-screen. The lone `@media(max-width:1100px)` rule
is stale (it sets `grid-template-columns` but `#workspace` is now flexbox) — remove/replace it.
Sequence (one shippable slice per loop; add Playwright checks at a phone viewport e.g. 390×844):
  M1. ✓ **Responsive shell** — shipped v39: real breakpoints, ⋯ More menu, stale @media killed.
  M2. ✓ **Panes → drawers on phone** — shipped v40: Library/Inspector become slide-in drawers; bottom tab bar (Library · Canvas · Inspector); scrim closes on tap; resize resets state.
  M3. ✓ **Touch interactions** — shipped v43: setPointerCapture + pointercancel on drag handlers; touch-action:none on handles; ≥36/40px tap targets; da-acts always visible on mobile.
  M4. ✓ **Mobile modals & builder** — shipped v43: bottom-sheet modals (full-width, sticky header, round top corners); sticky dsb-foot; font-size:16px for all modal inputs; DS type cards 1-col.
  M5. ✓ **Responsive exported dashboards** — shipped v44: header flex-wrap + padding reduction; grid already 1-col at ≤720px; 6 new M5 tests.
  M6. ✓ **Polish & a11y on touch** — shipped v45: momentum scroll, :active states for touch, inspector fonts enlarged, overflow-x:hidden guard; 5 new checks.
  M7. ✓ **Topbar buttons accessible on phones** — shipped v88: Examples/Open/Save hidden at ≤400px; phone-only More menu items; ≥44px touch targets; phone-pos fixed overlay for Examples menu; 4 new M7 checks.
  M8. ✓ **Restore banner must not block UI on mobile** — shipped v88: --mob-tabs-h variable; full-width stacked banner above tab bar at ≤640px; 1 new M8 check.
  > **Mobile follow-ups — shipped v109.**
  M9.  ✓ **Horizontal overflow / white side bar** — shipped v109: `html{overflow-x:hidden}` seals the root scroll channel; 2 new checks (html overflowX + scrollWidth ≤ viewport).
  M10. ✓ **Top menus reachable on phones** — shipped v109: Examples/Open/Save hidden from topbar at ≤640 px, accessible via ⋯ More; cascade order fixed (.more-phone-only global before @media block).
  M11. ✓ **Restore banner Cancel** — shipped v109: dismiss button renamed "No thanks" + min-height:44px on phone; 1 new check.
  M12. ✓ **Footer changelog on mobile** — shipped v109: changelog popup constrained to min(96vw,380px); status bar font/gap/padding tightened; build stamp hidden on phone; 1 new check.
  > **RE-FIXED + locked v116 — the v109 fixes were marked done but did NOT actually work (user-confirmed
  > on a real phone). They hid/constrained instead of fixing the interaction, and one had a CSS
  > source-order bug. Verified now with real navigation tests, not presence checks.**
  M13. ✓ **Topbar genuinely reachable** — v116: `.top-actions` scrolls horizontally (swipe) instead of
       `overflow:hidden` clipping buttons off the right edge; dropdown menus float to a fixed full-width
       sheet (`.top-actions .menu{position:fixed}`) so the scroll container can't clip them.
  M14. ✓ **Changelog truly within viewport** — v116: `#changelogPop` is viewport-fixed (left/right 8px);
       the v109 `.changelog-pop` rule was silently overridden by the LATER base `.changelog-pop` rule
       (equal specificity, later wins) — fixed by using the `#id` selector.
  > **MOBILE GATE (P0):** the `MNAV:` tests in `tests/run.js` now assert real mobile *function* at 390px —
  > no horizontal overflow, topbar swipe-reachable (both ends), dropdowns + changelog in-view, and the
  > Library/Inspector drawers actually open ON-SCREEN. **Keep them green.** When a mobile bug is reported,
  > first add/extend an MNAV check that reproduces it, then fix — never mark a mobile item done on
  > presence/width alone; verify the interaction actually works at phone width.

### D. Icon system — replace emoji glyphs with an elegant inline-SVG set (user-requested)
Goal: swap the ad-hoc emoji/unicode indicators (✎ 🗑 ⧉ ✕ ＋ ⓘ ◴ ☾ ⚙ ↶ ↷ ↻ ▶ ‹ › ⛁ ◧ ❖ ⟨⟩ etc.)
for a small, cohesive, **fashionable line-icon set** that looks sharp and theme-aware.
Best practice: one `Studio.icon(name[,size])` helper returning inline `<svg>` with `stroke:currentColor`,
`fill:none`, 1.5px stroke, 24-box viewBox — so it inherits color and **dark mode works for free**; no
icon-font, no network. Define a single sprite/registry (edit, trash, duplicate, close, plus, info,
clock, moon/sun, gear, undo, redo, refresh, chevron, caret, grip, check, warn, and the source-type
marks db/cube/gear/metadata/script). Sequence (one slice per loop):
  I1. ✓ **Icon registry + helper** — shipped v37: `app/icons.js` with 26 paths + `Studio.icon()`; unit/DOM tests (11/11 checks).
  I2. ✓ **Adopt across chrome** — shipped v41: delBtn/moveBtn/section-add/daCard-edit-del/myDACard-dup-del/DS_TYPES-cards/undo-redo all use SVG; CSS flex-centering; 11 new tests; 231/231.
  I3. ✓ **Adopt in canvas + modals** — shipped v42: canvas sr-act (⧉/×), KPI del, modal close, toast, all secondary topbar buttons, inspector btn-wide, DA-preview/pagination/chips/params/addP/addCC/Join all SVG; flashBtn saves innerHTML; test hook added; 243/243 (12 new I3 checks).
  I4. ✓ **Polish icon consistency** — shipped v46: aria-label on qInfoBtn+themeBtn; theme button upgraded to SVG moon/sun in boot; 3 new tests.
Keep it tasteful and consistent (uniform stroke + corner radius); align with the M3/M4 touch sizes.

### C. Go-live + verify
12. **Go live**: enable Pages (Settings → Pages → main /root) → DNS CNAME `dashboardstudio` →
    `kevinrhaas.github.io`. (Publish + auto-deploy Action both done; `PAGES_DEPLOY_TOKEN` set.)
13. **Verify live** against a reachable Pentaho (CORS+HTTPS, or same-origin/proxy) — untestable here.
14. Polish: server-import `.html` section in the Import-from-Server modal (done: per-panel query peek);
    **Cloudflare Access** runbook for managed email/SSO codes.

### E. Next-wave polish (high-value quality-of-life improvements)
- ✓ **E1. Restore-banner improvements** — shipped v49: panel/KPI/filter count in banner; boot load no longer clears autosave.
- ✓ **E2. Export history** — shipped v49: last 5 exports in the Export menu, time-ago timestamps, one-click re-export.
- ✓ **E3. Dashboard thumbnail** — shipped v62: `Studio.makeThumbnail(spec, theme)` returns an SVG layout preview; inspector shows it at dashboard level; examples gallery cards each have a mini thumbnail. 6 new tests.
- ✓ **E4. Deep-link parameters** — shipped v50: URL hash `#filterId=value` pre-selects filters in exported CDF; inspector shows shareable hash + Copy button.
- ✓ **E5. Examples gallery card grid** — shipped v51: 2-column card gallery with track badge, chart-type chips, title, and P/K counts. Featured CDF section. `index.json` enriched with metadata.
- ✓ **E6. Changelog search** — shipped v50: live search input in changelog popup; match highlighting; empty state.
- ✓ **E7. Changelog date + time** — shipped v51: optional `time` field in changelog entries; rendered as `date · HH:MM UTC` in the popout.
- ✓ **E8. Sign out / clear session + clear cache** — shipped v53.

### F. Visual chart types & richness — make it world-class (user-requested; build across iterations)
Goal: a **rich, modern, elegant, interactive** chart vocabulary that follows the latest data-viz best
practices — make the whole experience sexier and more fun to use. Today's registry: bars/donut/line/
stacked/areaStacked/combo/treemap/scatter/gauge/heatmap/table/kpi (+ sparkline in KPIs); chord & sankey
primitives already live in the vendored toolkit. Add **more first-class chart types** beyond these,
each selectable in the chart-type gallery, rendered in CDF/preview, and (where a CCC equivalent exists)
round-tripped to CDE. Best practice: extend via `app/studio-charts.js` (keep vendored `pdc-ui.js` a
pristine v2 mirror); inline the extension in exporters/CLI; add a gallery thumbnail + a Playwright check
per type; respect theme + the responsive/touch breakpoints. Candidate types, one shippable slice/loop:
  F1. ✓ **Sankey** (flow) — shipped v55: source/target/value column mapping; ribbon width proportional to flow volume; hover tooltip shows value + % of total; srcCap/dstCap Inspector options.

### G. Visual data-source builders — author queries visually (user-requested; extends track A)
Goal: a **visual builder for each CDA source type**, plus link/import of existing artifacts, so users
build the data behind dashboards without hand-writing XML/SQL. Slots onto the v31–v38 CDA model.
  G1. ✓ **Visual SQL query builder (slice 1/3)** — shipped v60: collapsible SQL Builder accordion in the SQL DA editor: FROM table, SELECT all/* or specific columns (chip-based), WHERE conditions (9 operators), ORDER BY ASC/DESC, LIMIT → "Generate SQL" writes aliased SELECT to textarea and triggers Detect Columns. 5 new G1 tests. Test suite 339/339.
  G1b. ✓ **Joins / multi-table SELECT** — shipped v61: JOIN section with type (LEFT/INNER/RIGHT/FULL OUTER) + table + ON condition; multiple JOINs stackable; clean SQL output. Test suite 346/346.
  G1c. ✓ **GROUP BY + aggregates** — shipped v61: AGG section (SUM/COUNT/AVG/MAX/MIN/COUNT DISTINCT + col + alias chips); GROUP BY column chips; both merge cleanly into generated SELECT. Test suite 346/346.
  G2. ✓ **Basic Kettle (.ktr) transform builder** — shipped v69: KTR Builder accordion (table input → select values → dummy output); step-flow diagram; Generate .ktr → well-formed PDI XML; Download .ktr. 5 new G2 tests.
  G3. ✓ **Link / import existing transforms** — shipped v70: "Import .ktr…" file button → parsed in-browser → step name chips → click to set output step. Studio.parseKtr in model.js. 5 new tests, suite 387/387. "Browse from server" (active-connection repo picker) remains as a possible G4 extension.
Keep each builder type-aware (mirror the per-kind editors from v33) and preview through the existing
offline sample-data path; CFD stays primary.

### H. Periodic UX / information-architecture refinement & best-practice cleanup (user-requested; RECURRING)
Goal: keep the whole app a **clean, logical, elegant, simple joy to use** — world-class, ahead of every
visual competitor, stunning and delightful, beginner-friendly with good helpers, fun and polished.
Forward-looking and genuinely innovative — press toward groundbreaking capability — but **evolve, don't
wildly rewrite**. This is an **ongoing** track: per the REFINEMENT CADENCE above, the loop should run a
refinement pass periodically (≈ every 5th run, or when the feature backlog is thin) instead of a feature.
A refinement pass = pick ONE small, shippable, well-tested slice from:
  - **IA / navigation** — review menus & grouping (topbar, ⋯ More, Export ▾, New ▾, Examples ▾,
    inspector sections); consolidate / rename / reorder for clarity; cut clicks; smart defaults;
    progressive disclosure (advanced options behind clear affordances so beginners aren't overwhelmed).
  - **Onboarding & guidance** — first-run clarity, empty states, inline hints/tooltips, helper text,
    the tour; goal: a newcomer is productive within minutes and delighted doing it.
  - **Visual polish** — spacing, typography, color, motion, density, consistency; modern best practices;
    tasteful (not noisy); full dark-mode parity; the "wow" on first open.
  - **Code health** — remove dead code/duplication, consistent naming, small behavior-preserving
    refactors, keep the model/render/studio/exporters boundaries cohesive.
Discipline: keep `tests/run.js` green (refactors must not regress — add/adjust checks), document the
rationale in the changelog, and prefer several small safe improvements over one risky overhaul. Each
pass should make the experience measurably simpler, cleaner, and more delightful than the last.

### I. Learn from the reference/ lab — match & surpass those visuals (user-requested; RECURRING)
The `reference/dashboards/` tree is a library of advanced hand-built CDF/CDE dashboards (the original
iteration-v2 suite) — e.g. network node-click drill-to-detail (`PDC.openDetail`), info dots, rich CDF
layouts and interactions. Periodically (≈ when doing track-F/visual work) **study the newest examples
there and port / improve upon the best techniques** into the Studio, so the builder can generate
dashboards at least as good as the hand-built ones — then push past them. Keep everything compatible with
the existing exporters and keep them emitting light, self-contained HTML/JS (see Conventions above — no
new runtime deps). Each pass: pick one technique, generalize it into the Studio model/render/exporters,
add a Playwright check, document it kindly, and note it in the changelog.
> **READ-MOSTLY boundary:** `reference/**` (the dashboard lab) and `provisioning/**` (DDL/ETL/deploy)
> are **read for inspiration, not churned** — only touch them when an improvement specifically calls
> for it (e.g. regenerating the catalog from `reference/dashboards/`). The loop's normal output is the
> app itself at the repo root (`app/`, `index.html`, `data/`, `tests/`, docs).

### J. Documentation — user help in the Pentaho docs style (user-requested)
Goal: real product documentation for Dashboard Studio, written in the **style and structure of the
Pentaho docs** — task-oriented topics, clear headings, getting-started → concepts → how-to → reference.
Keep it **HTML/JS, light, self-contained** (no doc-site framework, no new deps) — a `docs/` area that
ships with the build, plus a Help panel in the app. Add contextual **help links** throughout the UI.
  - ✓ **J1: Help docs page + in-app link** — shipped v97: `docs/index.html` self-contained reference
    guide; sections: Getting started, The builder, Chart types (20-type grid), Data sources & CDA,
    Exporting (format comparison table), Keyboard shortcuts, Simple vs Advanced mode. Sticky nav with
    active-section highlighting. 'Help docs ⓘ' in ⋯ More menu. K8 card links to it.
  - ✓ **J2: Contextual help links** — shipped v98: `.sec-help` SVG info-icon badge on 13 section headers; `#inspHelpLink` pane-header badge updates per-selection; all open docs in a new tab; SVG preserves h4.textContent for existing tests. 4 new J2 checks.
  - ✓ **J4: Contextual `?` links from chart type cards** — shipped v99: `.ct-help` hover-reveal SVG link on each gallery card; opens `docs/index.html#ct-{type}`; docs chart-types section expanded to 29 types with group headers, CDF/CDE badges, and `id` anchors. 4 new J4 checks.
  Next J-track:
  - ✓ **J3: In-app contextual Quick help** — collapsed-by-default "Quick help" section at the top of each inspector type with 3 practical tips; shipped v100.
  - ✓ **J5: Chart type descriptions in the gallery** — `.lb-desc` subtitle on every gallery card from `Studio.CHARTS[t].desc`; shipped v100.
  - ✓ **J6: Interactive tutorial / walkthrough** — spotlight-based 6-step guided walkthrough (Welcome → Library → Canvas → Inspector → Export → Done!); shipped v101.

### K. Simple mode — an optional, friendlier baseline experience (user-requested)
Goal: a persisted **Simple ⇄ Advanced toggle** (topbar) that makes the app approachable for newcomers
without removing power. Simple mode = progressive disclosure: hide expert controls, surface the common
chart types, a streamlined inspector, more guidance/sensible defaults, lighter chrome — so it isn’t
daunting. Advanced mode keeps the full, feature-rich set. **Additive, never a code fork** — one codebase,
gated UI. Keep building awesome features regardless; Simple mode just curates what’s shown.
  - ✓ **K1: Toggle + hide advanced sections + chart gallery filter** — shipped v91.
  - ✓ **K2: Gentle first-run onboarding** — shipped v92: topbar simple-badge pill; .simple-welcome inspector note with "Switch to Advanced" link.
  - ✓ **K3: Streamlined library** — shipped v92: CSS hides #btnNewDS, .mine-add, .da-mine-acts, .da-acts in Simple mode; library is read-only browse + drag-to-canvas.
  - ✓ **K4: Smart defaults in Simple mode** — shipped v93: chartForDA() Simple-mode heuristics (single numeric → gauge; multi-numeric → line; date → line); Advanced mode unchanged.
  - ✓ **K5: Simple mode DA inspector** — shipped v93: Calculated columns + Output options use advSection(); hidden in Simple mode; essentials-only inspector for newcomers.
  - ✓ **K6: Guided panel setup in Simple mode** — shipped v94: missingRequiredCols() detects empty required mapping; three-state guided card: no DA → nudge to pick a query; DA with 0 columns → amber warning pointing to Detect Columns; columns available → Auto-pick button (autoPickCols() assigns by name-heuristic). __studioSelect / __studioRenderInspector test hooks. H-track: "Edit data source →" jump link in panel inspector Data section (Advanced mode only). Test suite 522/522.
  - ✓ **K7: Beginner-friendly "Getting started" checklist** — shipped v95: 3-step card in Simple mode dashboard inspector (0 panels + 0 KPIs); auto-checked step 1 (library ready); CTA step 2 (add panel + Open library action); end-goal step 3 (export). Disappears once panels/KPIs added; absent in Advanced mode.
  - ✓ **K8: Onboarding walkthrough integration** — shipped v97: "What's next?" card in Simple mode dashboard inspector when ≥1 panel; 3 actionable next-step tips (configure chart / add panels / export); docs link; dismissible. Links to J-track help docs. Pairs with track H (IA) + track J (help).
- v98: **J2: contextual help links** — `#inspHelpLink` badge in inspector pane header (updates per-selection to builder/chart-types/data-sources anchor); `.sec-help` SVG info-icon badges on 13 section headers across all inspector types; SVG icon keeps h4.textContent clean; both open docs in a new tab. Test suite 543/543.
- v99: **J4: per-chart-type docs links + expanded chart reference** — every chart type card in the gallery now has a `.ct-help` SVG info-icon that appears on hover and links to `docs/index.html#ct-{type}`; `stopsPropagation` so it doesn't change the type. `docs/index.html` chart types section expanded from 20 → 29 types (added Radar, Chord, Network, Bullet, Calendar heatmap, Box plot, Dot plot, Beeswarm, Histogram), now organised under h3 group headers matching the builder gallery, with CDF/CDE badges per card and `id="ct-{key}"` anchors on all 29 entries. Test suite 547/547.
- v101: **J6: interactive tutorial** — `app/tutorial.js`: spotlight-based 6-step guided walkthrough (Welcome → Library → Canvas → Inspector → Export → Done); 4-panel dim overlay + purple highlight ring + smart-positioned tooltip card; keyboard Escape/→/←; `StudioTutorial.open()` wired to ⋯ More → "Interactive tutorial ▶"; test hooks `__studioTutorialActive`/`__studioTutorialStep`; `StudioTutorial.isDone()` (localStorage). 6 new J6 tests. Test suite 559/559.
- v105: **F19: Marimekko / Mekko chart** — new 24th chart type (Comparison group, CDF-only). Two-dimensional proportional stacked bars: column WIDTH ∝ category's share of the grand total; HEIGHT segments ∝ within-category composition; each cell area ∝ its fraction of the grand total. labelCol = category (x-axis + width driver), groupCol = segment (stacks; required), valueCol = numeric cell. % labels inside large-enough cells; hover tooltip (segment · category · value · share of column · share of total); compact top legend; animated entrance. Auto-pick maps strCols[0]→labelCol, strCols[1]→groupCol, numCol→valueCol. PDC.marimekko extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnail; model registry. 4 new F19 Playwright checks. Test suite 581/581.
- v108: **F22: Word cloud chart (27th chart type)** — Composition group, CDF-only; text items sized by numeric value (log scale 11–52 px); Archimedean spiral placement with bounding-box overlap detection; PDC.wordCloud extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); animated entrance; hover tooltips; inspector options: value format / height / max words; gallery SVG thumbnail. **H-track: Auto-save state indicator** — `#saveState` span in topbar flashes "Saved ✓" for 2 s after each localStorage auto-save (opacity fade; green accent; at rest invisible; ARIA live region). 6 new checks. Test suite 599/599.
- v107: **F21: Packed bubble chart (26th chart type)** — CDF-only force-directed bubble cluster; circle area ∝ value; deterministic 60-iteration gravity+repulsion simulation packs bubbles compactly without overlap; labels centred in bubbles, value in large ones; hover tooltips; animated entrance; capped at 60 items; PDC.packedBubble extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); Composition group. **H-track: Duplicate dashboard** — '⧉ Duplicate current' in New ▾ menu clones current spec with a new ID, " (copy)" title, "-copy" name stem; topbar New button flashes confirmation. 6 new checks. Test suite 593/593.
- v106: **F20: Dumbbell chart (25th chart type)** — horizontal connected-dot chart; two dots (gray start + brand-color end) per row connected by a color-coded line (green=improvement, red=decline); labelCol+startCol+endCol binding; animated entrance; value labels adjacent to dots; inspector Start/End labels; PDC.dumbbell extension (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnail. **H-track: Print/PDF button** in exported CDF header (printer SVG, `window.print()`); @media print CSS (static header, hidden controls, clean card layout, break-inside:avoid); export-only (not in preview iframe). 6 new checks. Test suite 587/587.
- v104: **F18: Bump / ranking chart** — new 23rd chart type (Trend group, CDF-only). Same labelCol + multi-series binding as Line/Step. At each period, all series are ranked by value (rank 1 = highest; dense ranking); smooth cubic-bezier curves connect each entity's rank position; line crossings show competitive overtaking; rank number inside each dot; hover tooltip (name / period / rank / value); series labels at right edge; animated entrance. PDC.bump extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnail; model registry. 4 new F18 Playwright checks. Test suite 577/577.
- v103: **F17: Violin plot + H-track: dashboard accent color** — Violin plot (22nd chart type, Distribution group, CDF-only): Gaussian KDE per category produces a symmetric filled silhouette (wider = denser); Silverman bandwidth selection; optional IQR box + median line; hover tooltip (n, median, Q1/Q3, min/max); PDC.violin extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery SVG thumbnail; model registry. Dashboard accent color (H-track): 'Accent color' field in dashboard inspector with 6 preset swatches + custom hex picker; stored as spec.themeColor; propagated to preview + exported CDF as :root{--pentaho:...} CSS override; empty = default Pentaho blue. Test suite 571/571.
- v102: **F16: Step chart + H-track: gallery group filter tabs** — F16: Step/staircase chart (21st type, Trend group, CDF-only): right-angle horizontal-then-vertical step transitions between discrete values; area fill option; animated stroke-dashoffset entrance; hover tooltips; PDC.step extension in studio-charts.js (pdc-ui.js pristine); gallery thumbnail; model registry + newPanel auto-mapping. H-track: chart gallery group filter pills (`.cg-filter`/`.cg-tab`): narrow the 21-type gallery to one category — clicking a pill shows only that group's cards; active pill in brand blue; cards tagged with `dataset.grp`; "All" pill resets. Test suite 565/565.
- v100: **J5: chart type descriptions in the gallery + J3: Quick help contextual tips** — J5: every chart gallery card now has a `.lb-desc` one-line subtitle (e.g. "Compare values across categories") from a new `desc` field in all 28 `Studio.CHARTS` entries; 8px faint text, 2-line clamp. J3: every inspector type (Dashboard, Panel, KPI, Filter, DA) gets a collapsed-by-default "Quick help" section with 3 contextual tips; `quickHelp(body, type)` helper in studio.js; `.qh-tips`/`.qh-tip` CSS. H-track collapse tests updated to pick an already-expanded section. Test suite 553/553.

### L. Architecture & code-review sweeps (RECURRING — sweep type 2; see SWEEP CADENCE)
Every ~5th run's architecture slot: review the codebase like a demanding senior engineer and fix **one**
concrete health issue behind green tests (no behavior change). Rotate the lens each time so the whole app
gets covered over time:
- **Module boundaries** — model/render/studio/exporters/shell should stay cohesive; catch cross-layer leaks
  and functions that have drifted into the wrong file. `studio.js` is the largest surface — watch for
  extract-worthy chunks (inspector, gallery, menus) as it grows.
- **Dead code & duplication** — unused helpers, copy-pasted logic (e.g. repeated SVG-embed / color-token /
  format code across chart extensions), stale CSS. The Z0 CDE-exporter removal lives here too.
- **Global-state creep** — the `Studio.*` namespace and `PDC._reg` redraw registry: keep them intentional,
  documented, and leak-free (listeners cleaned up, no orphaned iframes).
- **Performance budget** — track total JS/CSS size and preview render cost; lazy-load heavy/rare paths
  (this is the natural home for lazy-loading the Z14 wasm engines); avoid O(n²) in chart layout code.
- **Accessibility** — periodic keyboard-only + screen-reader pass; color-contrast in every theme×mode;
  focus management in modals/drawers/slideshow.
- **Chart-extension API** — 51 types now register through ad-hoc patterns; consider formalizing a tiny
  `Studio.defineChart({type, render, opts, thumb, autoPick})` contract so new types are uniform and testable.
- **Test health** — coverage per feature, flaky/slow checks, and a fast smoke subset for quick loops.
> **Findings log (append newest on top; keep short):** _(none yet — first architecture sweep will seed this)_

### N. Innovation backlog — leading-edge concepts (RECURRING/GROWING — sweep type 3; see SWEEP CADENCE)
> This is the "look back + look forward, be exceptionally innovative" list (user-requested 2026-07-02).
> The north star is **meant to keep expanding.** On an innovation sweep: add 2–4 genuinely novel ideas here,
> then optionally ship the smallest delightful slice of one. Everything must still honor the constraints:
> **pure HTML/JS, no backend, config local, self-contained exports, game-like Polecat aesthetic.** Grouped
> by theme; not ordered — pull whatever is ripe. Promote an idea into a Z/lettered track once it's committed to.

**N-AI — Intelligence layer (bring-your-own-key, browser-side).**
- **Natural-language → dashboard:** describe what you want ("weekly revenue by region with a target line")
  and generate a starter spec — NL → chart type + column mapping + query. BYO API key stored locally.
- **NL query bar over a live source:** text → SQL → chart. Becomes real the moment Z14 DuckDB-Wasm lands
  (query a Parquet/CSV by asking in English). The killer combo with the connector track.
- **Auto-insight narration ("Explain this chart"):** client-side stats detect trend, seasonality, outliers,
  and biggest movers, then write a one-paragraph plain-English summary + auto-place callouts/markers on the
  notable points. No API needed — pure JS math (ties to Z7).
- **Smart chart recommender:** given a bound DA's shape (cardinality, types, row count), suggest the 3 best
  chart types with a why. Guides newcomers; upgrades the gallery from a menu to an assistant.

**N-FUN — Engagement, delight & "game-like."**
- **Command palette (⌘K / Ctrl-K):** fuzzy-jump to any action, chart type, data source, example, or setting.
  The single highest-leverage "feels modern & fast" upgrade.
- **Story / scrollytelling mode:** author an ordered, annotated narrative through a dashboard (extends
  Slideshow) — each step pans/zooms/highlights and shows a caption. Present findings, not just charts.
- **Live "what-if" parameter sliders:** on-canvas sliders that drive derived series / forecasts and animate
  the charts as you drag — analysis as play (pairs with Z7).
- **Build-completeness meter + gentle achievements:** a tasteful, game-like progress ring that nudges toward
  a great dashboard (has KPIs? a target? a filter? a title?) — on-brand fun without being corny.
- **Data-driven motion system:** spring-physics transitions between filter/data states so numbers *move*
  meaningfully; a coherent motion language across the app (respect reduced-motion).
- **Delight moments:** confetti/spark on first publish, playful empty-states, easter-eggs — small, rare, tasteful.

**N-DATA — Analytical depth (toward standalone analytic apps).**
- **Cross-filter / brushing everywhere:** click or brush any chart to filter the whole dashboard, with a
  visible active-filter bar and one-click clear. The feature that makes a dashboard feel *alive*.
- **Dashboard-wide formula language:** calculated fields across data sources (not just CDA calc columns) —
  a small safe expression engine (`[revenue] - [cost]`, `pctChange(...)`, `movingAvg(...)`).
- **Period-over-period / compare mode:** pick two ranges or two sources and diff them across every panel.
- **Pivot / crosstab builder** and **anomaly + correlation explorer** as first-class analysis surfaces.

**N-DIST — Distribution & platform reach (still backend-free).**
- **Embeddable single-chart widget:** export one panel as a tiny self-contained embed snippet/iframe.
- **Installable PWA + offline:** we already ship a webmanifest — make Studio installable and fully offline
  (service worker caching the app shell + examples). A dashboard app you can "install."
- **Client-side PNG/PDF export of a whole dashboard** (canvas/`html-to-image`-style, dependency-light) and
  print-perfect layouts — for sharing where a link won't do.
- **Shareable state links / snapshots:** encode the full spec (or a diff) into a URL/file so a dashboard
  travels without a server (extends the existing `#hash` deep-link).
- **Local version history & visual diff:** timeline of auto-saved spec snapshots with a side-by-side diff
  (beyond in-session undo) — "time travel" for a dashboard.

**N-DESIGN — Make it unmistakably sexy.**
- **Theme studio & gallery:** author/share custom themes (theme × light/dark, extends Z10); a few stunning
  presets (warm Polecat, neon, editorial, high-contrast); optional per-dashboard theme.
- **Chart "skins":** alternate render moods — hand-drawn/sketch, glass/depth, editorial-minimal — as a
  toggle, so the same data can feel playful or boardroom.
- **Depth & material polish:** tasteful gradients, soft shadows, glassmorphism accents pulled from
  polecat.live; a coherent elevation/spacing scale.

**N-DEV — Power-user & authoring.**
- **Live JSON spec editor** with schema validation + inline errors (edit the `.studio.json` directly, see
  the canvas update) — power users and debugging.
- **Keyboard-first everything** (builds on the ⌘K palette + existing shortcuts) and a shortcuts cheat-sheet.
- **Dashboard templates/variables** — parameterized starting points beyond the examples.

## Quality bar
Every iteration: builds, `tests/run.js` green, UI cohesive, README/STATUS updated, commit + push.
Prefer several small, well-tested, shippable improvements over one big risky one.
